      "description": "Sir John ColpoysPortrait by W. SavageBornc. 1742Died4 April 1821Greenwich HospitalAllegiance Kingdom of Great Britain United KingdomService / branch Royal NavyYears of service1756 – 1821RankAdmiralCommandsPlymouth CommandGreenwich HospitalBattles / wars\n\nAdmiral Sir John Colpoys, GCB (c. 1742 – 4 April 1821) was an officer of the British Royal Navy who served in three wars but is most notable for being one of the catalysts of the Spithead Mutiny in 1797 after ordering his marines to fire on a deputation of mutinous sailors. Although this event resulted in his removal from active duty, Colpoys was a capable administrator who remained heavily involved in staff duties ashore during the Napoleonic Wars and was later a Lord of the Admiralty, Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath (later a Knight Grand Cross) and Governor of Greenwich Naval Hospital.\n\nColpoys was the son of John Colpoys, a Dublin attorney and Registrar to Chief Justice William Yorke.  His mother was a Miss Madden whose mother was Anne, daughter of Edward Singleton, an alderman of Drogheda in Ireland.  Singleton's son, Henry, was Chief Justice of the Common Pleas in Ireland from 1740 to 1753, while his granddaughter Charity, daughter of his son Rowland, was the wife of William Yorke, who succeeded Henry Singleton as Chief Justice of the Common Pleas in Ireland in 1753.  Nothing is known of Colpoys' birth or childhood, except that he was born in approximately 1742. He is believed to have entered the Royal Navy in 1756 at the outbreak of the Seven Years' War and certainly served in the Siege of Louisbourg in 1758 and the Capture of Martinique four years later. His service in these campaigns was not especially notable, but they were to be almost his only experience of action with the enemy.[1] While serving at Martinique, Colpoys was promoted to lieutenant and in 1770 received his first command, the small frigate HMS Lynx. Promoted commander the same year, he was again promoted in 1773, becoming a post captain in command of the ship of the line HMS Northumberland.\n\nAt the outbreak of the American War of Independence, Colpoys took command of the frigate HMS Seaford, which he commanded in European waters without seeing any significant action. In 1778, shortly after leaving the frigate, Colpoys was called to an Admiralty court as a judge in the court-martial of Sir Hugh Palliser in the acrimonious aftermath of the First Battle of Ushant. As instructed, the court found Palliser innocent of any wrongdoing and Colpoys returned to sea as commander of HMS Orpheus on the North American Station.[1] In Orpheus, Colpoys achieved his one victory at sea when, in company with HMS Roebuck, he successfully ran down and captured the small frigate USS Confederacy in 1781. His final command of the war was HMS Phoebe, a frigate with the Mediterranean Fleet that was paid off a few months after he joined her in 1783.[1]\n\nAfter seven years on half-pay, Colpoys was recalled in 1790 to command the guardship HMS Hannibal at Portsmouth. With the renewal of conflict with France in 1793 in the French Revolutionary Wars, Colpoys was recalled to active service as a squadron commander under Alan Gardner in the Channel and subsequently the West Indies. In April 1794, Colpoys was promoted to rear-admiral and flew his flag in HMS London with the Channel Fleet under Lord Bridport, with his nephew Edward Griffith as his flag captain. In 1795, London was present but not engaged at the Battle of Groix,[1] and later at the action of 10 April 1795.\n\nOrdered to command the blockade squadron off Brest in the winter of 1796, Colpoys was driven offshore by gales and detached a squadron of frigates under Sir Edward Pellew to watch the port. On 16 December, the French attempted to escape at dusk, the Brest fleet carrying an army intended for the invasion of Ireland. Although Pellew spotted the attempt and tried to divert the French during the night, the majority of the French forces reached the Atlantic safely. Rather than pursue the French, Colpoys took his ships into Plymouth for a refit while the main body of the Channel Fleet hunted for the invasion force.[1] The expedition was eventually foiled by a combination of disorganisation and severe gales.\n\nColpoys most notable action during his naval service occurred in 1797, after the outbreak of the Spithead Mutiny in April. Disaffected sailors in the Channel Fleet at Spithead went on strike, demanding a number of concessions before they would return to offensive operations. Although all but four ships returned to service within days following negotiations with the Admiralty, tensions were still running high.[1] The four ships that refused to sail were all placed under Colpoys's command while the remainder of the fleet were taken to St Helens, Isle of Wight to isolate the mutinous ships. On 1 May, an order from the Admiralty arrived with the fleet ordering officers to use violent methods to break the mutiny and to arrest its ringleaders. Aware that the order would provoke a recurrence of the original mutiny, many officers attempted to stifle news of the order, but without success.[1]\n\nThe crews at St. Helens once again rose against their officers, and Colpoys at Spithead took urgent steps to ensure the loyalty of his own crew on HMS London. The sailors were called on deck and asked to air any grievances they might have; the crew replied that they had none, and Colpoys dismissed them.[1] Worried about the potential influence of mutineers from the fleet at St. Helens, Colpoys then attempted to isolate his crew by sealing them below decks. This infuriated the men, who demanded an audience with the admiral. Colpoys refused to allow their delegates on deck, and the crew attempted to storm the hatches. Colpoys panicked, and ordered his officers and marines to open fire on the sailors climbing out of the hatches. Although most of the marines refused the order, a number of sailors were killed before Colpoys brought an end to the gunfire.[1]\n\nOutnumbered by his now thoroughly mutinous crew, Colpoys was forced to surrender. Taking full responsibility for the shooting, to spare one of his officers threatened with hanging for shooting a sailor, Colpoys and his fellow officers were seized and imprisoned, while London sailed to St. Helens to join the fleet.[1] Although the crew originally planned to try Colpoys and his officers for the shooting, they were all later released ashore. Colpoys was later explicitly named in the mutineer's demands as an officer they would refuse to serve under.[1] Colpoys was removed from active service at this time, although this may not have been a condemnation of his actions: he had already requested to be relieved before the mutiny due to his deteriorating health.[1]\n\nNo longer serving at sea, Colpoys began to recover his health and was rewarded for his long service in 1798 with appointment as a Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath. Remaining in semi-retirement, Colpoys was promoted to full admiral in 1801, and recalled by the Admiralty in 1803 to be the Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth.[1] The following year, Lord Melville specifically requested Colpoys to serve as a Lord of the Admiralty and he was also considered for the post of commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, although this was eventually awarded to Cuthbert Collingwood.\n\nIn 1805, Colpoys was awarded the honorary position of treasurer of Greenwich Hospital, and in 1816 he became governor of that institution.[2] In the preceding year at the reformation of the orders of chivalry, Colpoys had become a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath.\n\nIn 1821, Colpoys died at the Greenwich Hospital aged 79, and was buried on the site.[1] He is listed on the south face of the Officers Monument there.\n\nLaughton, J.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.Find sources: \"ODRL\" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (October 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\n\nThe Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is a policy expression language that provides a flexible and interoperable information model, vocabulary, and encoding mechanisms for representing statements about the usage of content and services. ODRL became an endorsed W3C Recommendation in 2018.[1]\n\nAn example of ODRL policy follows, which can be simply interpreted as \"John Doe can Play the asset mysong.mp3\".\n\nODRL was initially created in 2000, to address the burgeoning needs of the digital rights management (DRM) sector when media players were first introduced to the marketplace.[2] Version 1.1 of the ODRL language was quickly adopted by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) as their core standard for mobile media content protections and for managing digital objects. To date, ODRL is arguably the largest mobile implementation of a rights language, currently operating on over a billion compatible devices.\n\nODRL was managed by an independent Initiative, hosted by IPR Systems and led by Renato Iannella, before becoming a W3C Community Group in 2011. This move has provided long-term stability of the specifications and a transparent governance model.\n\nIn 2013, two new media sectors adopted ODRL: the eBook publishing and news industries. The International Press and Telecommunication Council (IPTC) news consortium adopted ODRL for the communication of usage policies, primarily in association with the licensed distribution and use of news content in the online news marketplace.\n\nIn the current virtual goods environment, content assets purchased or permissioned by a consumer are often locked into the same platform where content was initially consumed due to interoperability of rights expressions across platforms. ODRL Version 2.0 recognized it is equally important to state Permissions and Prohibitions in an expression language representing both DRM and non-DRM digital objects, broad adoption of this advanced model can reduce friction across digital devices and enable transparent transactions between machines in accordance with the specified policy language.\n\nODRL policy model framework currently supports traditional rights expressions for commercial transactions, open access expressions, and privacy expressions for social media.\n\nIncluded within the ODRL documentation are a number of basic use cases demonstrating how to implement policy expressions using the Core Model with terms from the Common Vocabulary. ODRL is fully extensible and provides a mechanism for new communities to extend and/or deprecate the ODRL Common Vocabulary used in conjunction with the Core Model.\n\nAn example of how the ODRL Profile and Vocabulary may be extended is found in the IPTC RightsML profile. The robust framework of ODRL allows for a wide variety of business models to be expressed and to address the requirements of multiple communities, such as social networks, publishers, image libraries, and education. Other profiles, such as the ODRL profile of Creative Commons were developed.\n\nThe ODRL Community Group is a World Wide Web (W3C) Community Group still supports the promotion and future development of the W3C ODRL recommendations.\n\nOther W3C Community Groups have adopted ODRL as the core Policy language and have developed a Profile to meet their community requirements, such as the Rights Automation for Market Data Community Group for pricing and trading data for financial instruments.\n\nIn the ODRL Core Model, the Policy is the central entity that holds an ODRL policy together. In its encoded form, e.g. in a JSON or XML document, it makes the policy addressable from the outside world via its unique UID attribute. A policy can refer to multiple permissions, duties and prohibitions.\n\nA Permission allows a particular Action to be executed on a related Asset, e.g. “play the audio file abc.mp3″. A Constraint like “at most 10 times” might be added to specify the Permission more precisely. The Party that grants this Permission is linked to it with the Role assigner, the Party that is granted the Permission is linked to it with the Role assignee, e.g. “assigner VirtualMusicShop grants the Permission to assignee Alice”. Additionally, a Permission may be linked to Duty entities that means there are obligations on the assigner to fulfil in order to exercise the permission.\n\nSimilar to Permissions, a Duty states that a certain Action may be executed by the Party with the Role assignee for the Permission to be valid, e.g. “Alice must pay 5 EUR in order to get the Permission to play abc.mp3″.\n\nThe Prohibition entity is used in the same way as Permission, with the key difference that it forbids the Action, e.g. “Alice is forbidden to use abc.mp3 commercially”.\n\nThe ODRL Core Vocabulary defines the semantics for the concepts and terms from the ODRL Information Model. The ODRL Core Vocabulary represents the minimally supported terms for ODRL Policies.\n\nIn addition, the ODRL Common Vocabulary defines semantics for generic terms that may be optionally used in ODRL Profiles by communities.\n\nODRL can be implemented in three serializations: JSON, XML, and Turtle. Communities adopting ODRL can use standardized actions for Permissions, Prohibitions, and Duties that are expressed in policy statements.\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/community/odrl/ W3C ODRL Community group, the international effort to develop and promote ODRL\n\nhttps://copyrightandtechnology.com/2018/02/18/world-wide-web-consortium-embraces-odrl-rights-language/ World Wide Web Consortium Embraces ODRL Rights Language",

It was written and produced by Klas Åhlund. The song was initially released as a promotional single in Sweden in 2005. It received a proper single release on 22 October 2007, as the album's third international single and fifth overall. It was later released as the second single in the United States on 1 April 2008. The song was described as a feminist anthem about a man who believes he is cool, but Robyn thinks he is not and she wants to tell him that. The song utilizes thudding beats and string instruments, including violas, violins and guitars.\n\nThe song received generally positive reviews from critics, who noted its potential of becoming a hit. Commercially, the song reached the top twenty in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. It also peaked at number five on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart. It charted moderately elsewhere, peaking at number thirty-six in the Flanders region in Belgium, and reaching the lower half on the charts in Ireland, the Netherlands, and Germany. A low budget music video was made for the song for the album's release in Sweden and features Robyn and her friends outside at night. In 2007, Robyn made a new video with director Johan Renck. The clip sees Robyn standing in colored boxes of different shapes and sizes.\n\n\"Handle Me\" and \"Crash and Burn Girl\" were released as promotional singles in Sweden, in 2005.[1] \"Handle Me\" was released via digital download as the album's third single in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 22 October 2007.[2][3] A CD single was later released in the UK on 29 October 2007,[4] and on 7 March 2008 in Germany.[5] The song was released as the second single from the album in the United States on 1 April 2008.[6] The song was written and produced by Klas Åhlund.[7] In an interview with British newspaper Metro, Robyn spoke about \"Handle Me\", saying, \"It’s a fun song about any guy who thinks he’s really cool but really isn’t and I’ve got to tell him.\"[8]\n\nChris Willman of Entertainment Weekly considered the song \"a less nasty but even hookier version of Pink's lounge-lizard-repelling 'U + Ur Hand'.\"[9] The song begins with thudding beats, accompanied by \"serious-sounding\" violas and violins.[10][11] David Hyland of WMUR-TV wrote that it utilizes \"cheesy guitar flourishes\" in the chorus.[10] Hyland referred it to as a feminist anthem due to the \"brutality and directness to the lyrics\". He wrote, \"Robyn sounds undeniably sweet as she defies and then details the seedy exploits of a controlling bar owner who seeks to be her paramour. She trounces him in a manner we're not accustomed to in normally breezy confines of pop music.\"[10] Danny Corvini of Australian website Samesame.com.au wrote that the song is about \"boyfriends who can’t keep up\".[12] In the chorus, Robyn tells the man, \"You’re a selfish, narcissistic, psycho-freaking, bootlicking Nazi creep/And you can’t handle me.\"[13] The North American version of Robyn censors the word \"Nazi\" by reversing it.[13]\n\nNick Levine of Digital Spy awarded \"Handle Me\" four out of five stars, and wrote, \"[Robyn]'s on rum old form on 'Handle Me', her follow-up tune [to \"With Every Heartbeat\"], taking it upon herself to put a very arrogant young man in his place.\" He concluded his review, saying that due to the song's backdrop, beats and blips, \"Robyn sounds as if she's been beamed in from Mars. In the best possible way, of course.\"[14] Talia Kraines of BBC Music wrote that \"Jamelia would kill for a ballad as elegant as 'Handle Me'.\"[15] Dan Cairns of The Sunday Times wrote that it includes the \"unforgettable put-down: “You’re a selfish narcissistic psycho freaking bootlicking Nazi creep.” The line comes, it should be noted, at the end of a killer chorus. A killer pop chorus.\"[16] David Hyland of WMUR-TV wrote, \"The record's most striking track is \"Handle Me,\" not only because of it has the potential to be a monster hit, but also because it's an interesting combination of contradictory impulses.\"[10]\n\n\"Handle Me\" debuted at number forty-three on the UK Singles Chart on the issue dated 3 November 2007.[17] The following week, it reached its peak of number seventeen. The song spent a total of eleven weeks on the chart.[17] In New Zealand, the song entered at number thirty-six on the issue dated 10 December 2007. After ascending on the chart for several weeks, the song reached its peak of number nineteen on the issue dated 21 January 2008, and stayed in that position for two weeks.[18] In the United States, \"Handle Me\" debuted on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart at number forty-nine on the issue dated 24 May 2008. The song steadily ascended during the following weeks and reached its peak of number five on the issue dated 26 July 2008.[19] In the Flanders region in Belgium, the song peaked at number thirty-six and spent four weeks on the chart.[20] \"Handle Me\" also reached number fifty-seven in Ireland,[21] sixty-seven in the Netherlands,[22] and eighty-six in Germany.[23]\n\nThe first music video for \"Handle Me\" was directed by Fredrik Skogkvist for the album's Swedish release.[24] Speaking of the video, Robyn said, \"It's an older video and it was done at a point where all the videos that I made for the album were made here in Sweden. They were made here when the album was first released and were very low budget videos. Which I think is great – I don't mind working with low budget kind of videos.\"[25] Robyn asked director and singer Johan Renck for advice when she started her own record label. At the time, Robyn said that she \"hardly had any money to make music videos – and [Renck] doesn't do low-budget stuff – so he hooked me up with people who could help me out.\"[26] The video begins with Robyn and a group of people outside at night. Robyn wears a tank top and several gold necklaces around her neck. Other scenes show her wearing a hooded sweatshirt, and others wearing a red dress while bicycling.\n\nIn an interview with About.com in February 2008, Robyn explained that the album's UK release in 2007 inspired her to make new music videos for \"Handle Me\" and \"Be Mine!\"[25] She enlisted Renck for the new video for \"Handle Me\" because she wanted a challenge. She said, \"I like people I work with to challenge me and that's what I get with Johan. He is unafraid to take risks. Some directors are so focused on their original idea that they freak out as soon as you try something new. They miss out on the possibilities.\"[26] The clip features various solo shots of Robyn while she is dancing in colored boxes and others showing only her head. Several shots include showing her in silhouette and with various props such as a chair, life jackets and smaller boxes.\n\nThe second music video premiered on 9 October 2007.[27] A writer for music website Stereogum praised Robyn for making good videos. The writer said, \"This must be why [her eyebrows are] black while the top’s not in this vid for “Handle Me,” one of Robyn's many vid-worthy songs. In it she's doing her “I’m fly” boasting, representing your inability to handle her via breaking out of boxes and jump cuts to her humping a stuffed animal and a dancing ninja. Don't analyze, just enjoy.\"[28]",

The theme music Riddle wrote for the series, said his biographer, “was one of the most fitting and identifiable weekly television themes ever written.”[1]\n\nThe program was an immediate hit and received four Emmy Awards in its first season, more than any single program.[2] This spurred Capitol Records to rush production on an album of original music from the show.[3] The album was released in September 1960.[4]\n\nThe liner notes characterize Riddle’s effort as “tabloid-headline music that evokes and reports on a bygone era of irresistible appeal,” including several tracks devoted “to the vintage jazz that punctuated the gunfire.” The memorable theme “marches on the listener as inexorably as Time marched on [gangsters] John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd.”[5]\n\nThe album was rushed to recording in June 1960, on the heels of “The Untouchables” having won four Emmy Awards, in a hopefully successful tie-in to the popular TV show.[3]\n\nCash Box attributed the \"thundering impact which the [show] has had on audiences\" in part to \"the vivid Nelson Riddle score,\" including the \"pulsating main theme.\"[6]\n\nBillboard called the album a \"strong package,\" which \"features a haunting score\" that included \"catchy jazz-age-styled instrumentals of the 1920s and some dramatic musical impressions of mobsters of that era.\"[7]",

      "description": "The men's college basketball program of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) was founded in 1920 and is known competitively as the  UCLA Bruins. The Bruins have won 11 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I national championships, the most of any  school.[1] UCLA players have been assigned jersey numbers ranging from 0 to 78 in the team's history.[2]  The school no longer issues nine retired numbers in honor of 10 former players. To qualify, a player must have been a three-time consensus All-American, a consensus national player of the year, or been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The retired numbers are displayed in the rafters of the Bruins' home arena, Pauley Pavilion.[3] UCLA's legendary coach John Wooden generally opposed having numbers retired.\n\nNumbers retired by UCLA were originally limited to three-time consensus All-Americans.[4] In 1990, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, known as Lew Alcindor during his UCLA career, and Bill Walton were the first to have their numbers retired.[5] The ceremony was held in conjunction with the 25th anniversary of Pauley Pavilion.[a][6][7] Wooden valued team play over individual accolades, and he opposed retiring numbers.[4][8] \"What about the fellows who wore that number before?\" Wooden asked. \"Didn't they contribute to the team?\"[8] Wooden did think highly of Abdul-Jabbar and Walton. \"If such a thing can be deserved, it'd be Alcindor and Walton. But I don't think it would be anyone else,\" said Wooden.[9]\n\nUCLA in 1996 expanded the requirements for retiring numbers to include players who were consensus national players of the year.[4] This allowed the jersey numbers of Walt Hazzard (No. 42), Sidney Wicks (35), Marques Johnson (54), and Ed O'Bannon (31) to be retired.[9] In 2004, UCLA also allowed players inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame to be eligible, enabling the retirement of Gail Goodrich's No. 25.[4][10] Three Bruins were inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2012, and UCLA retired their numbers in 2013—Jamaal Wilkes (52), Reggie Miller (31), and Don Barksdale (11).[11] It was the second time No. 31 was retired, O'Bannon's being the first.[12]\n\nEight of the players honored were members of NCAA championship teams,[13][14] and seven of the players were coached by Wooden.[15] Although Hazzard's No. 42 was retired, he allowed Kevin Love (2007–2008) to wear it.[2][16][17][18] Johnson's retired No. 54 was worn by his sons, Kris (1994–1998) and Josiah (2001–2005).[2][19]\n\nIn 2014, UCLA announced that No. 42 would be retired across all the university's sports in honor of Jackie Robinson, a four-sport star at UCLA who went on to a Hall of Fame career in Major League Baseball after breaking the baseball color line. While Robinson wore several different numbers while at the school from 1939 to 1941, UCLA chose to honor the iconic No. 42 that he wore during his career with the Brooklyn Dodgers.[20] The announcement had no impact on the men's basketball program, since the number was already retired for Hazzard, who had requested No. 42 as his college number to follow in the footsteps of Robinson, his childhood idol.[21] Robinson also played basketball for the Bruins, but he wore No. 18.[22]",

It was released on 10 June 2016.[2] Odell's first major release since his 2013 debut, Long Way Down, achieved international success, it was also his first album released via RCA Records.[3]\n\nThe album was announced on 4 April 2016, along with the release of its lead single, \"Wrong Crowd\". Odell also released a music video for the song on the same date, in addition to the announcement of a new tour.[3] The album, released on 10 June 2016, was co-produced by Odell alongside Jim Abbiss, who has previously worked with artists like Arctic Monkeys, Kasabian and Adele.[2] Regarding the concept and production of the new album, Odell said,I wanted the songs to sound big and dramatic; big strings and melodies emphasizing the songs further – rich in musicality and holding nothing back. The album follows a narrative of a man held at ransom by his childhood, yearning for it, yearning for nature- a desire for innocence in this perverse world in which he now lives. It’s a fictional story but the emotions and feelings are obviously ones I have felt – though the stories are elaborated and exaggerated. I wanted to create a world with a heightened sense of reality.[4]\n\nOn 4 April 2016, Odell announced that he would go on tour and perform a series of intimate shows at venues across Europe and the United States in support of the album.[5] Tickets for his shows, titled the No Bad Days Tour, completely sold out.[6]\n\nNo.TitleWriter(s)Producer(s)Length1.\"Wrong Crowd\"OdellRick NowelsOdellJim Abbiss4:272.\"Magnetised\"OdellNowels[7]OdellAbbissNowels3:573.\"Concrete\"OdellOdellInflo3:494.\"Constellations\"OdellAndy BurrowsOdellAbbiss4:365.\"Sparrow\"OdellOdellAbbiss4:566.\"Still Getting Used to Being on My Own\"OdellNowelsOdellAbbiss3:037.\"Silhouette\"OdellJamie ScottOdellAbbiss4:478.\"Jealousy\"OdellOdellAbbiss3:499.\"Daddy\"OdellOdellAbbiss3:1810.\"Here I Am\"OdellBurrowsOdellAbbiss3:2911.\"Somehow\"OdellOdellInflo6:52\n\nDeluxe edition (additional tracks)No.TitleWriter(s)Producer(s)Length12.\"She Don't Belong to Me\"OdellNowelsOdellAbbiss3:5813.\"Mystery\"OdellNowelsOdellAbbiss4:2414.\"Entertainment\"OdellOdellRich Cooper3:3015.\"I Thought I Knew What Love Was\"OdellOdellCooper3:46",

The discovery of petroleum in Titusville, Pennsylvania, rendered his job obsolete, so he traveled to Titusville to research what new materials might be created from the new fuel. As he was strolling around the oil field, he found out about something called rod wax, also known as petroleum jelly, a jellylike substance that was cleaned off of the pumping equipment often. Chesebrough was told it was a nuisance, except when someone had a cut or burn; they found that if it was rubbed on an injury, then it would lessen the pain and make the injury heal quicker. He then trade-named the jelly as Vaseline.\n\nIn 1875, he founded the Chesebrough Manufacturing Company, a leading manufacturer of personal-care products. Chesebrough patented the process of making petroleum jelly (U.S. patent 127,568) in 1872. By 1874, stores were selling over 1,400 jars of Vaseline a day.[3]\n\nChesebrough's success stemmed from a firm belief in his product. Before he began selling petroleum jelly, he tested it on his own cuts and burns. Chesebrough was still unable to sell any to drug stores until he traveled around New York demonstrating his miracle product. In front of an audience, he would burn his skin with acid or an open flame, then spread the clear jelly on his injuries while demonstrating past injuries, healed, he claimed, by his miracle product.[4]  In reality, it doesn't heal cuts and burns, the jelly forms a layer, causing dirt to not get in (one of the leading causes of death and disease in his day were due to open wounds being infected) and trapping the moisture in. To further create demand, he gave out free samples, one of the first instances of it ever being done.\n\nChesebrough opened his first factory in 1870. The first known reference to the name Vaseline is in his U.S. patent: \"I, Robert Chesebrough, have invented a new and useful product from petroleum which I have named 'Vaseline…'\" . The word is believed to come from German Wasser (water) + Ancient Greek: έλαιον (élaion, oil).[5]\n\nChesebrough lived to be 96 years old and was such a believer in Vaseline that he claimed to have eaten a spoonful of it every day.[6][7] He died at his house in Spring Lake, New Jersey.[8]  He also, reportedly, during a serious bout of pleurisy in his mid-90s, had his nurse rub him from head to foot with Vaseline. He soon recovered, and credited his recovery to Vaseline.[9][7] He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City.\n\nAuthority control databases InternationalISNIVIAFFASTWorldCatNationalGermanyUnited StatesPeopleDDBOtherNARASNAC",

      "description": "This article contains characters used to write reconstructed Proto-Indo-European words (for an explanation of the notation, see Proto-Indo-European phonology). Without proper rendering support, you may see question marks, boxes, or other symbols instead of Unicode combining characters and Latin characters.\n\nThe numerals and derived numbers of the Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) have been reconstructed by modern linguists based on similarities found across all Indo-European languages. The following article lists and discusses their hypothesized forms.\n\nOther reconstructions typically differ only slightly from Beekes and Sihler. A nineteenth-century reconstruction (by Brugmann) for thousand is *tūsḱmtiə.[3][4] See also Fortson 2004.[5]\n\nThe elements *-dḱomt- (in the numerals \"twenty\" to \"ninety\") and *dḱm̥t- (in \"hundred\") are reconstructed on the assumption that these numerals are derivatives of *deḱm̥(t) \"ten\".\n\nLehmann[6] believes that the numbers greater than ten were constructed separately in the dialect groups and that *ḱm̥tóm originally meant \"a large number\" rather than specifically \"one hundred.\"\n\nOIr ceth(a)ir (fem. cethēoir, influenced by fem. tēoir \"three\") \"four\"; W pedwar (fem. pedair) \"four\"\n\nThe numbers three and four had feminine forms with the suffix *-s(o)r-, reconstructed as *t(r)i-sr- and *kʷetwr̥-sr-, respectively.[5]\n\nSpecial forms of the numerals were used as prefixes, usually to form bahuvrihis (like five-fingered in English):\n\nThe ordinal numbers are difficult to reconstruct due to their significant variation in the daughter languages. The following reconstructions are tentative:[20]\n\n\"first\" is formed with *pr̥h₃- (related to some adverbs meaning \"forth, forward, front\" and to the particle *prō \"forth\", thus originally meaning \"foremost\" or similar) plus various suffixes like *-mo-, *-wo- (cf. Latin primus, Russian perv-).\n\n\"second\": The daughter languages use a wide range of expressions, often unrelated to the word for \"two\" (including Latin and English), so that no PIE form can be reconstructed. A number of languages use the form derived from *h₂enteros meaning \"the other [of two]\" (cf. OCS vĭtorŭ, Lithuanian añtras, Old Icelandic annarr, modern Icelandic annar).\n\n\"third\" to \"sixth\" were formed from the cardinals plus the suffix *-t(ó)-: *tr̥-t(ó)- / *tri-t(ó)- \"third\" etc.\n\n\"seventh\" to \"tenth\" were formed by adding the thematic vowel *-ó- to the cardinal: *oḱtow-ó- \"eighth\" etc.\n\nThe cardinals ending in a syllabic nasal (seven, nine, ten) inserted a second nasal before the thematic vowel, resulting in the suffixes *-mó- and *-nó-.

It occupies most of the area of the eponymous island on Susquehanna River. The power plant has three major units, which came online in 1961, 1965, and 1969, with respective generating capacities of 334 MW, 390 MW, and 759 MW (in winter conditions). In addition, three internal combustion generators (2.8 MWe each) were installed in 1967.[1] Talen Energy will stop coal use at the plant in 2028.[2]\n\nPPL, the owner of the plant at the time, announced in 2005 that it would begin to install scrubbers at the plant and that installation would be complete by 2009. The scrubbers, PPL says, are intended to annually remove 100,000 tons of sulfur.[3] The facility was cited as one of several facilities in the region by a USA Today study of air quality around area schools as a potential source of significant pollutants.[4] Fly ash from the Brunner Island facility is approved for use in construction projects, especially for \"use in concrete mixes to reduce alkali silica reactivity of aggregate.\"[5]\n\nIn 2021, the facility produced 2.28 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) greenhouse gas emissions.[6] This is the same climate impact as 491,312 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles driven for one year.[7] With respect to greenhouse gas emissions, out of 89 power stations in the state, Brunner Island ranks as the 13th most polluting.[8]\n\nIn 2006, Brunner Island ranked 27th on the list of most-polluting major power station in the US in terms of sulphur dioxide gas emission rate: it discharged 20.49 pounds (9.29 kg) of SO2 for each MWh of electric power produced that year (93,545 tons of SO2 per year in total).[9] Scrubbers began operation in 2009, removing about 90-percent of sulfur dioxide emissions and reducing mercury emissions.[10][11] They spray a mixture of crushed limestone and water onto the exhaust gas before it goes out the plant's chimney. Sulfur reacts with the limestone and water in the plant's exhaust, forming synthetic gypsum. This is collected and shipped to a drywall manufacturing company.[12][13]\n\nBrunner Island discharges all of its waste heat (about 1.44 times its electrical output) into its brand new cooling towers as of 2009.\n\nAs part of a 2018 out-of-court settlement with the Sierra Club, which had previously sued the plant and its current owner, Talen Energy, over air and water pollution, Brunner Island will eventually completely phase out coal. By 2023, Brunner Island will stop burning coal from May to September, which is considered peak smog season.  By 2028, the facility will have completely switched over to natural gas.[14]",

He played college football for the California Golden Bears and was selected by the Broncos in the seventh round of the 2010 NFL draft.\n\nThompson was born on February 7, 1987. in Sacramento, California, to mother Patrice Thompson. He is also the brother of Carolina Panthers' linebacker Shaq Thompson. He attended Grant Union High School where he played football and earned all-state honors three times. As a junior in 2004, he recorded 950 rushing yards for 18 touchdowns, 15 receptions for 360 yards and four touchdowns, returned five punts, and returned one kickoff for a touchdown. That year, Rivals.com ranked him the number-one junior player in the state, and he received the California Mr. Football Award. As a senior, he recorded more than 70 tackles, two interceptions, 1,000 rushing yards, and 12 touchdowns. He received an invitation to play in the CaliFlorida Bowl. The Sacramento Bee named him to its all-metro second team.[1]\n\nScout.com rated him the number-five player in its West Hot 100. Rivals.com rated him the 13th-ranked athlete in the nation and the 21st-ranked player in California. ESPN assessed him as the 11th-ranked cornerback in the nation. PrepStar named him an All-American, as did SuperPrep, which also rated him the 17th-ranked defensive back in the nation and the 13th-ranked player in California.[1] Thompson was rated a four-star prospect by both Scout.com and Rivals.com.[2][3] He received scholarship offers from Arizona, California, Kansas State, Oklahoma, Oregon, UCLA, and Washington.[2]\n\nThompson enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley where he majored in social welfare. He sat out the 2005 season as a redshirt. In 2006, starting cornerback Tim Mixon suffered a knee injury before the season, which forced Thompson to fill in that role for the remainder of the season.[1] In the season-opener against Tennessee, Thompson played with a cast because of a broken wrist and was twice outpaced by All-American wide receiver Robert Meachem for touchdown receptions. Tennessee won, 35–18.[4] Thompson started all 13 games of the season, and he recorded 60 tackles including 35 solo, two fumble recoveries including one returned for a touchdown against Stanford, and one interception. The Sporting News named him to its freshman All-Pac-10 team. In 2007, Thompson again started all 13 games and recorded 78 tackles including six for loss, ten broken-up passes, and one interception.[1]\n\nIn 2008, he started in all 13 games at cornerback and as served as the punt returner. He recorded four interceptions for 128 yards and 18 passes defended. Against Washington State, he set a school single-game record with 108 interception return yards.[1] In that game, he intercepted one pass and returned it 90 yards, before being caught by Washington State running back Christopher Ivory five yards short of the goal line. California scored on its ensuing possession, but Thompson reported he was teased by his teammates and asserted that he \"was good for the first 40 yards, but then my back and my hip started tightening up\".[5] Against Colorado State, he returned a punt 73 yards for a touchdown, for which he was named the Pac-10 Special Teams Player of the Week. Thompson received the team's Andy Smith Award for most playing time, and he was named to the All-Pac-10 first team.[1]\n\nThompson is on the watch list for the 2009 Lott Trophy, which is an award bestowed upon the nation's best defensive player with strong character.[6] He has also been declared a preseason All-American by many various publications.[4] In preseason predictions for California, many analysts have named California's secondary a major strength, largely because of Thompson.[7][8] When asked to name his four most important teammates, California linebacker Worrell Williams included Thompson as the only defensive player. He said, \"So what's that tell you? He's going to shut down one side of the field when he's out there.\"[9]\n\nThe NFL Draft Scout, a CBS Sports affiliate, rated Thompson 15th of its Top 32 seniors for the 2009 season, and wrote, \"His straight-line speed, agility, reliable open-field tackling and natural return skills would be earning significantly more attention from the national media if he played in the Big Ten or SEC.\"[10] The NFL Draft Scout assessed him as the best cornerback out of the 226 available for the 2010 NFL draft and projected him as a first or second round selection.[11] Following his senior season, Thompson represented Cal at the 2010 Senior Bowl\n\nThompson was selected in the seventh round of the 2010 NFL draft by the Broncos as the 225th overall selection.[12] He recorded his first NFL interception against the New York Jets on October 17, 2010.[13] On September 2, 2011, during the Broncos' last preseason game at the Arizona Cardinals, Thompson suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon, and missed the entire 2011 season. Thompson was released from the Denver Broncos roster during the roster cuts before the 2012 regular season.[14]\n\nOn February 3, 2014, Thompson was traded, along with Quentin Sims and Andre Freeman, to the Orlando Predators for Simeon Castille.[15]\n\nThompson's younger brother Shaq was one of the most touted recruits of the class of 2012.[17] He committed to California on March 6, 2011,[18] but a week later, he re-opened his recruitment.[19] On January 7, 2012, he re-committed to California, but re-opened his commitment once again. On January 30, he committed to the University of Washington. He was selected in the 2015 NFL Draft by the Carolina Panthers.",

      "name": "New Jersey in the American Civil War",
      "description": "The state of New Jersey in the United States provided a source of troops, equipment and leaders for the Union during the American Civil War. Though no major battles were fought in New Jersey, soldiers and volunteers from New Jersey played an important part in the war, including Philip Kearny and George B. McClellan, who led the Army of the Potomac early in the Civil War and unsuccessfully ran for President of the United States in 1864 against his former commander-in-chief, Abraham Lincoln.[1]\n\nThe Quaker population of New Jersey was especially intolerant of slavery. However, it ended up becoming the last northern state to abolish slavery, enforcing a period of indentured service in advance of full liberation.\n\nNew Jersey passed an act for the gradual abolition of slavery in 1804, it was only in 1830 that most blacks were free in the state. However, by the close of the Civil War, about a dozen African-Americans in New Jersey were still apprenticed freedmen. New Jersey at first refused to ratify the Constitutional Amendments that banned slavery. New Jersey was a major part of the extensive Underground Railroad system.\n\nOn May 4, 1861, in a response to President Abraham Lincoln's call to arms the U.S. War Department directed New Jersey to fill a quota of three infantry regiments to serve a three-year term of enlistment. Recruitment took place for the new regiments all over the state, and on May 21, the 1st New Jersey Volunteer Infantry was mustered into the Union Army at Camp Olden in Trenton under Maj. Theodore T. S. Laidley of the United States Regular Army. The 9th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry, under Col. Joseph W. Allen at Camp Olden, was the last New Jersey regiment to leave the state in 1861 but the first committed to battle. Additional regiments were raised throughout the war, including cavalry and artillery.[1]\n\nNo battles took place within New Jersey throughout the course of the Civil War. However, over 88,000 soldiers from New Jersey were part of several infantry and cavalry regiments. In total, 52 regiments were created by New Jersey soldiers during this war. 23,116 of those soldiers served in the Army of the Potomac. Soldiers from New Jersey fought generally in the Eastern theater of the Civil War.[2] Over 6,000 soldiers from New Jersey lost their lives in the war. Philip Kearny, an officer from the Mexican–American War, led a brigade of New Jersey regiments under Brigadier General William B. Franklin. Kearny distinguished himself as a brilliant officer during the Peninsula Campaign, and was promoted to the rank of major general.\n\nAnother notable officer from New Jersey was Major General Gershom Mott, from Trenton. He served as brigade and division commander and temporarily led the II Corps. Major General Hugh Judson Kilpatrick was one of the first officers to be wounded in the war. He infamously fought in the Battle of Gettysburg and served as Sherman's cavalry leader in the Atlanta Campaign. After the war he served as ambassador to Chile. Colonel Harvey Brown, of Clark, was a veteran of the regular army. He served to great success in Florida and initially commanded the defences during the New York Draft Riots. Brigadier Generals from New Jersey include George W. Taylor, Charles A. Heckman, Joseph W. Revere, Charles G. Harker and Theodore Runyon.\n\nOn 24 March 1863, the New Jersey legislature passed a resolution that included many aspects of the situation caused by the war. Some of the aspects were:[3]\n\nAgainst proclamations from any source by which, under the plea of \"military necessity,\" persons in states and territories sustaining the federal government, and beyond necessary military lines, are held liable to the rigor and severity of military law\n\nAgainst all arrests without warrant—against the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in states and territories sustaining the federal government, \"where the public safety does not require it\"—and against the assumption of power by any person to suspend such writ, except under the express authority of Congress\n\nAgainst the power assumed in the proclamation of the President made January one, eighteen hundred and sixty-three, by which all the slaves in certain states and parts of states are forever set free—and against the expenditure of the public moneys for the emancipation of slaves or their support at any time, under any pretence whatever\n\nNew Jersey was one of the few states to vote for Stephen Douglas instead of Abraham Lincoln in the 1860 presidential election. The people of New Jersey also gave its electoral votes to George McClellan when he ran for president against Lincoln in the election of 1864, being the only free state that rejected Lincoln twice. McClellan later became the governor of New Jersey, from 1878 to 1881.\n\nMany cities like Paterson and Camden, grew extremely strong through the duration of the Civil War. They produced many necessities, including clothing and war materials like ammunition. These cities prospered through constant production even after the end of the war. Cities like those of Paterson and Camden became crucial to the Northern war effort. With the Union's ability to manufacture more supplies, the Union was able to defeat the Confederates and successfully conclude the war and reunite the country.[4]\n\nBussanich, Lenny. \" 'To Reach Sweet Home Again': The Impact of Soldiering on New Jersey’s Troops During the American Civil War.\" New Jersey History 125.2 (2010): 37–61.\n\nCox, Christopher.

The Glacier Park Limited came to be when another one of Great Northern's St. Paul to Seattle routes, The Oregonian was renamed. The Limited also had a split with a small consist going to Portland along the route of the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway. The train was meant to promote Great Northern's on-line scenic attraction Glacier Park as a tourist destination, advertising the park's unequaled scenery and easy access by its trains, which stopped on both the Eastern and Western edge of the park.\n\nThe route taken by the Glacier Park Limited was similar to that of most of Great Northern's Oriental Limited, running from St. Paul to Seattle. The Westbound Glacier Park Limited started in St. Paul, before passing through Willmar, Fargo, New Rockford, Minot, Havre, Whitefish, Spokane, and Cascade Tunnel before ending in Seattle. Eastbound, the limited started in Seattle, and passed through Spokane, Whitefish, Havre, Minot, Devils Lake, Grand Forks, and St. Cloud before reaching St. Paul.\n\nThe Glacier Park Limited operated from April 25, 1915, until May 31, 1929, when the Empire Builder's creation just a few weeks later made 3 trains along the same route redundant. During World War I, with American railroads controlled by the United States Railroad Administration, the Limited did not operate west of Havre from May 26, 1918, until May 30, 1920,[1] a few months after the USRA relinquished control of the railroads back to their companies. The Oriental Limited took over the Glacier Park Limited's train numbers of 3 & 4 on the GN timetable once the Empire Builder took train numbers 1 & 2.[2]\n\nDespite not being the flagship train of the Great Northern, The Glacier Park Limited still enjoyed luxuries seen on The Oriental Limited and later The Empire Builder, including Observation Cars to see the scenery, especially in the Rockies and Cascades. The Limited was pulled by some of the best Locomotives the Great Northern had to offer, including E-14s and H-4 Pacifics. Near the end of the train's lifecycle P-2 locomotives pulled the train. GN used their electric locomotives to pull the train through both the old Cascade Tunnel as well as the current tunnel.[3]",

      "name": "Keijō Imperial University",
      "description": "Keijō Imperial University京城帝國大學TypeNationalActive1924 (1924)–August 1946 (1946-08)LocationKeijō (Seoul), Keiki-dō, Korea, Empire of Japan\n\nKeijō Imperial University[a] was an Imperial University in Keijō (Seoul), Korea, Empire of Japan that existed between 1924 and 1946.\n\nThe university was seen as the preeminent educational institution in colonial Korea. Upon the 1945 liberation of Korea, it was briefly renamed Kyŏngsŏng University, was seized by the United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK) in 1946, and reorganized into its successor: the present Seoul National University.\n\nIn 1923, an organization called the Korea Private University Foundation Committee (조선민립대학기성회; 朝鮮民立大學期成會) was formed. Its founding leader was Yi Sang-jae [ko]. In response to their activism, the Japanese Government-General of Chōsen agreed to a proposal (경성제국대학령) to found a university in Korea.[1]Keijō Imperial University Preliminary SchoolKeijō Imperial University was founded in 1924. For the first two years, students were enrolled only in the preparatory education division (予科), which was similar to the Higher Schools in mainland Japan, except it was a year shorter and included Japanese language instruction for Korean students, as most faculty members were Japanese. When the first group of students completed their preparatory education in 1926, three-year programs for law and literature were introduced, along with a four-year medical program.[2]\n\nThey began gradually adding new programs over time, based on what was deemed important for colonial Korea. An article in the Encyclopedia of Korean Culture argues that science and engineering programs were deliberately not introduced until around Japan's entry into World War II. The article argues this was because Japan wanted to avoid disseminating technical and scientific knowledge to Koreans. Research activities were limited, and there were maximum quotas for how many Koreans were allowed to be admitted.[1] An alumnus of the university testified in 2010 that bureaucrats were held in much higher esteem than engineers and scientists in colonial Korea, which led to the law program becoming excessively popular.[3]\n\nIn 1928, a hospital affiliated with the university finished construction. In April 1929, it graduated its first class of 90 law and literature students, 22 of whom were ethnic Koreans. In 1930, it graduated its first class of 55 medical students, with 12 Koreans. In March 1934, it extended the liberal arts program to three years. In 1938, it established a science and engineering department, and increased the class sizes for that program in 1941.[1]\n\nAfter the liberation of Korea, Keijō Imperial University was renamed to \"Gyeongseong University\" (경성대학; 京城大學). After the war, it was no longer considered a Japanese university, and it was closed by the USAMGIK on August 22, 1946, under US Military Ordinance No. 102. While speaking to Korean officials, the U.S. Military Governor stated that the U.S. \"gave a basic law enacted which will place our national university on a level equal to the best in the world.\"[4]\n\nThe remaining properties of Keijo University merged with Gyeongseong Industrial School, Gyeongseong Mine School, Gyeongseong Medical School, Suwon Agriculture School, Gyeongseong Economics School, Gyeongseong Dental Medicine School, Gyeongseong Normal School and Gyeongseong Women's Normal School into Seoul National University. Additionally, Seoul National University College of Medicine was established in 1946 through the merger of Keijō Medical School and Keijō Imperial University.[5]\n\nKeijō Imperial University published original articles and abstracts in journals including Shinkeigaku-zassi (Neurologia), Seishin-shinkei-gaku zassi (Psychiatria Et Neurologia Japonica), and The Journal of Chosun.\n\nThe Keijō Imperial University research team organised and conducted field studies on sampling of blood typing, as well as physical anthropology research from people representative of the Korean peninsula. The gathering of men and women by local police and administrative power had been conducted as measuring them was necessary for the progression of Keijō Imperial University's physical anthropology research. In 1937, Keijō Imperial University extended its research of physical anthropology field studies to Manchuria and China. Keijō Imperial University's field studies in Korea, Manchuria and China were financially supported by the Japanese government and research foundations.\n\nControversies surrounding Keijō Imperial University's research of physical anthropology and blood typing is related to the use of a racial index [R.I. (= A%+AB%/B%+AB%)].[6] Professor Ock Joo Kim of Seoul National University states “the Japanese researchers put Koreans as a race between the Mongolian and the Japanese. The preoccupation with constitution and race also pervasively affected the medical practice: race (Japanese, Korean, or Japanese living in Korea) must be written in every kind of medical chart as a default”.[7]\n\nThe division of law and literature encapsulated studies belonging to law, literature, history and philosophy.\n\nAt Keijō Imperial University, students had the opportunity to publish their literary works. In a preparatory literature course, students published in the magazine titled 'Seiryo'. In a regular course, students had the publish their literary works in the magazine titled 'Jōdai Bungaku'.\n\nSeoul National University College of Medicine was established in 1946 after the abolishment of Keijō Imperial University by the merger of Keijō Medical School and Keijō Imperial University. The first class graduated in 1947.[8]\n\nThe Governor-General of Korea's Office Hospital was developed into a hospital attached to the faculty of medicine at Keijō Imperial University in 1928. The hospital had a psychiatry ward which was the only psychiatric institution in Korea at the time. Results shared by Keijō Imperial University psychiatrics Kubo Kiyoji and Hattori Rokuro, the psychiatric ward had admitted 576 Japanese patients, and 508 Korean patients from its establishment to 1930.[9]\n\nKeijō Imperial University was under the jurisdiction of the Governor-General. As there was not enough funding for both Keijō Imperial University's medical department alongside the Governor-General of Korea Hospital, therefore, staff from the Governor-General's Hospital were transferred to Keijō Imperial University's medical department. At the Keijō Medical Professional School, professors, assistant professors and assistants lectured in Mental Science. The hospital connected to the university was expanded to have 222 beds with a total of 35 physicians, with staff including directors, medical officers as well as professors.[10] Keijō Imperial University's medical department contributed towards the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology up until 1945 by members of the medical department and professors of psychiatry. Studies at Keijō Imperial University included publications on insanity, symptomatic psychosis, sleep disorder, epidemiology, alcohol and morphine addiction, and schizophrenia.\n\nKeijō Imperial University was the only institution in Korea to have psychiatric beds until 1931 when a psychiatric was established within the Severance Union Medical School Hospital.\n\nTwenty-nine research papers and abstracts on psychiatric treatments were presented and reviewed at Keijō Imperial University. Major research areas included biological psychiatry and biological treatment. During this time, Japanese psychiatrists had introduced German psychiatry into Japan and Keijō Imperial University. Professors who contributed towards this research included Professor Kubo, Dr. Hattori, Dr. Hikari and Professor Suits. Malarial fever therapy, as well as sulphur-induced fever therapy and insulin shock treatment were frequent research topics at Keijō Imperial University. Six more papers on psychotherapy were published at the university, two being on persuasion therapy, three being case reports on psychoanalytic therapy, and one paper being on Sigmund Freud. Psychoanalytical therapy research has shown evidence that there had been limited triads conducted in the follow-up of literal guidance, where further development was not noted.[11]\n\nKeijō Imperial University also conducted studies relating to pharmacology, psychology, pathology and parasitology. Amongst these, topics for medical research included the research into control of infectious diseases, hygiene and environmental health for Japanese and Koreans.\n\nFor Korean individuals, admission into Keijō Imperial University was a very competitive process as the admission of Korean students was restricted to between one-fourth and one-third of the total number of enrolled students at Keijō Imperial University. By 1930, six years after Keijō University was established, the number of enrolled students was at 520. This was equivalent to 6.7 percent of the number of students enrolled at Tokyo Imperial University. Japanese students made up the majority of the students enrolled. Amongst two thousand graduates during the colonial period, the number of Korean graduates was at seven hundred, the other thirteen hundred being Japanese.[12]\n\nIn 1934, the total enrolment of the Keijō Imperial University was 930 students. The percentage of Korean students which made up this number was of 32%. Although the Korean percentage rose in the coming years, namely in 1942 where the percentage of Korean students was at 39%.[13]\n\nIn 1943, Keijō Imperial University had 67 professors and 203 students who were Japanese. Three professors and 170 students were Korean.[14]\n\nKiyoki Kubo – Kubo was offered a professorship at Keijō Imperial University when the medical school was established.\n\nMost of the staff at Keijō Imperial University specialised in the fields of physical anthropology, publishing and composing a series of works on Korean physical anthropology which were included within the Journal of the Anthropological Society of Nippon.\n\nAuthority control databases InternationalISNI2VIAF2NationalGermanyUnited StatesJapanKoreaIsraelAcademicsCiNii",

      "description": "Roy Roedger (born October 11, 1958) is a retired German ice hockey player born and raised in Canada. Roedger, of German descent, left Canada for Germany in 1978 and played eleven seasons there. He also fielded for the German national team at two Olympic games and six World Championships. After the end of his career he returned to Canada.\n\nRoedger, born in Weston, Ontario of German descent, started his playing career with the Prince Albert Raiders in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League.[2]\n\nRoedger was discovered in 1978 by Heinz Weisenbach, coach of the Mannheimer ERC in the German Ice hockey Bundesliga. Weisenbach went to Canada to discover whether he could find Canadian ice hockey players of German descent who were eligible to obtain a German passport and therefore would not take up one of the limited permissible spots for foreigners. Additionally, they would also be eligible for the German national team. Weisenbach flew to Toronto and contacted German clubs in Canada to make contacts. He watched a number of junior games and eventually discovered a number of young players, among them Roedger, his brother Peter, Harold Kreis, Manfred Wolf, Ralph Krueger, George Fritz, Mike Schmidt, and Karl Friesen. Weisenbach managed to convince some of them to join his club, Mannheimer ERC while others, like Friesen, later appeared in the Bundesliga and for Germany for other clubs. It marked the beginning of an influx of ethnic German Canadians, the Deutschkanadier, in German ice hockey and on the national team.[3]\n\nRoedger joined Mannheim, freshly promoted to the Bundesliga, and by 1980, the club won the national championship, giving credit to Weisenbach's initially belittled recruitment effort.[3]\n\nRoedgers played for six seasons at Mannheim and, from 1982, also for the German national team. While at Mannheim he played in three World Championships and the 1984 Winter Olympics for Germany.[4] In 1985, in a friendly against Switzerland, he was part of the Canadian bloc of the German team when, for the first time, all skaters on the ice were born in Canada, a novelty in German ice hockey. The players were Roedger, Krueger and Wolf as forwards while Kreis and Schmidt played defense, all discovered for Germany by Weisenbach.[3]\n\nIn the 1984–85 season, Roedger was involved in an incident in which he hit Kölner EC player Steve McNeil in the right eye with his stick. In the scene, which was repeated on German television many times, McNeil is shown to lose a lot of blood. McNeil lost up to 50 percent of his vision in the right eye and Roedger was forced to pay him compensation after an out-of-court settlement but intent was never proven and it was generally considered to be an accidental foul.[5]\n\nAt the end of the 1984–85 season, Roedger left Mannheim for the Düsseldorfer EG. With Düsseldorf, he won one more German championship in his last season, 1989–90, and also took part in three more World Championships and the 1988 Winter Olympics. In 1990, aged 31, he retired from Bundesliga ice hockey.[2][4]\n\nRoedger returned to Canada after his career ended. He acquired a degree in sports and event marketing and formed SDI Marketing, a sports marketing agency of which he is the CEO.[6]\n\nRoedger's younger brother Peter (born 1960) also played in Germany, starting his career with Berliner SC in 1981, playing for a season with his brother in Mannheim in 1982–83 before dropping down to the 2nd Ice hockey Bundesliga. He played, until 1992, for Eintracht Frankfurt, Duisburger SC and EC Kassel.[7]\n\nGünter Klein: 30 Jahre Eishockey-Bundesliga (in German) Copress Verlag, published: 1988, ISBN 3-7679-0289-3",

The station is a major hub in the national railway network. Located about 1 km from the city center, Saigon railway station is the final station on the North–South railway, and the southernmost point of the Vietnamese railways.[1][circular reference] Despite the city being named Ho Chi Minh City after the Vietnam War, the name of the station has remained the same.\n\nThe colonial railway head office which is located in front of the former Saigon Station, now is the Vietnam Railways main booking office of HCMC.\n\nThe first Saigon station, which opened in 1885 as part of the Saigon–Mỹ Tho Railway, was located near the Quách Thị Trang Square in District 1. In 1904, Hanoi-Nha Trang Railway was opened but the first Saigon station was too small, so the colonial authorities decided to move the station. The second Saigon station was located at the southwest of the Bến Thành Market and constructed in 1915. The current (third) Saigon station was opened in 1983 at Hòa Hưng, District 3.[2]\n\nEvery year, one or two months before Tết, thousands of people queue all day at the station to buy tickets home, because it is the main booking office of Vietnam Railways. Though electronic booking machines have been adopted, the queues continue, due to the monopoly of the railway.\n\nDue to the requirements of urban planning, the city government is considering the relocation of the station to the city outskirts at Binh Trieu (Binh Trieu Railway Station).[3][4]",

With his business partner, Andy Taylor, whom he met while studying at Trinity College, Cambridge, he founded the Sanctuary Records Group in 1979, which became the largest independent record label in the UK and the largest independent music management company in the world until its closure in 2007. Prior to managing Iron Maiden, Smallwood managed Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel.\n\nSmallwood was born and raised in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, where he grew up listening to The Beatles and The Rolling Stones on the radio and playing cricket and rugby union.[1] It was only when he began attending university that his musical interests expanded and he began listening to Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, Grateful Dead and The Doors.[1]\n\nIn the autumn of 1968, Smallwood began studying architecture at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he soon became involved in organising social events, such as the annual Trinity May Ball,[1] for which he booked the \"various acts\".[2] It was while undertaking these duties that he formed a friendship with fellow undergraduate and future business partner Andy Taylor.[2] From then on, Smallwood and Taylor worked on end-of-term events together and booked various musicians, including Graham Bond, Chris Farlowe, Bridget St John, John Martyn,[3] and, most notably, the MC5.[4] Smallwood acquired most of these artists from a local booking agency, Horus Arts, whose boss, Barry Hawkins, gave Smallwood advice which led to his career as a booking agent.[5]\n\nShortly before his final exams in 1971, Smallwood dropped out of university and moved to Paris with his girlfriend,[6] stating that \"it just seemed like the cool thing to do\".[6] After three months in Paris, Smallwood undertook a job at a London booking agency, Gemini, in order to finance a trip to Morocco.[6] Through his work with Gemini, Smallwood was offered a \"£35 a week\" job with rival agency MAM, and therefore abandoned his trip to Morocco.[6] After 18 months with MAM, Smallwood began managing English rock act Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel. Smallwood disliked working with Harley, whom he would later describe as \"a pain - selfish, egotistical, obsessed\" and thus \"completely put me off management.\"[7] Convinced by EMI, Harley fired Trigram, his management agency, and Smallwood undertook the management of punk rock act Gloria Mundi.[8]\n\nIn 1979, Smallwood decided to return to university to obtain a law degree, where he was given a copy of Iron Maiden's demo tape.[9] After much deliberation, Smallwood eventually contacted Steve Harris, the band's bassist and founder member, and arranged two pub gigs for the group in west London, one at the Windsor Castle in Maida Vale and the other at The Swan in Hammersmith.[10][11] Neither show went to plan: the first was cancelled after the band refused to play early,[10] and the band had to perform the second without lead vocalist, Paul Di'Anno, who was arrested for carrying a knife 30 minutes before the gig.[12] In spite of this, Smallwood agreed to help the group, although, following his experiences with Steve Harley, he did not initially commit to becoming their full-time manager until he arranged the band's signing to EMI and publishers Zomba at the end of the year.[13] Eventually joined by Andy Taylor in 1982,[14] the pair have managed the group ever since.\n\nAfter committing himself to managing Iron Maiden in October 1979, Smallwood decided to form his own management company, which he would name after Iron Maiden's second single, \"Sanctuary\".[15] Sanctuary Records Group eventually expanded into the largest independent record label in the United Kingdom[16] until its closure in 2007.[17] Prior to this, in November 2006, Smallwood left Sanctuary and formed Phantom Music Management with Andy Taylor, which focuses solely on Iron Maiden.[18]\n\nThe Iron Maiden b-side \"Sheriff of Huddersfield\" was written by Iron Maiden about Rod Smallwood, and was released on the 1986 single \"Wasted Years\". It likens Smallwood to the Sheriff of Nottingham, due to his notorious stinginess with money, and refers to his frequent complaining about a (then recent) move to Los Angeles. Smallwood did not know about the song until the single was released.",

      "name": "Phrynobatrachus phyllophilus",
      "description": "Phrynobatrachus phyllophilus is a species of frogs in the family Phrynobatrachidae. It is found in Sierra Leone, southern Guinea, Liberia, and Ivory Coast.[3][4] Prior to its description in 2002, it was confused with Phrynobatrachus guineensis,[2][3] one of its closest relatives.[4] The specific name phyllophilus is derived from the Greek phyllon for leaves and philein for loving. It refers to on the close association of this species with leaf litter.[2][4]\n\nAdult males measure 12–17 mm (0.47–0.67 in) and adult females 15–23 mm (0.59–0.91 in) in snout–vent length. The snout is moderately pointed. The tympanum is small but distinct. The digits are enlarged to discs. The fingers are unwebbed but the toes are moderately webbed. Roughness of the skin changes within individuals; skin is normally smooth in reproductive males. The dorsal colouration ranges from beige to dark brown. There are black lateral bands. Flanks have sometimes clear spots on flanks, ranging from white, yellow, yellow with a red central part, or red with a fine orange border in colour. There might be a broad orange to red transverse band may cross the back. There is one (occasionally two even three) dark transverse bar on femur and tibia. The belly is white. Throat is black in reproductive males but can be almost white with few blacks spots in non-reproductive males. Females have white to gray throats with irregular dark spots and patches.[2][4]\n\nThe tadpoles are uniformly brown with hyaline fin carrying few small dots. The largest tadpoles (ready to metamorphose) measure 13 mm (0.51 in) in total length, including a 5 mm body. Metamorphosed froglets measure about 5 mm (0.20 in) in snout–vent length.[2][4]\n\nPhrynobatrachus phyllophilus occur in swampy parts of primary rainforest at elevations up to 1,000 m (3,300 ft) above sea level, possibly higher.[1] They live in leaf litter.[2] The eggs are deposited terrestrially close to water,[1][2] the only Phrynobatrachus known to do so.[2] The tadpoles develop in extremely small puddles.[1][2] The diet consists mostly of insects, particularly coleopterans.[5]\n\nPhrynobatrachus phyllophilus is a very common species. It is negatively impacted by habitat loss caused by agricultural development, logging, and expanding human settlements. It might also be locally threatened by mining activities. It occurs in several protected areas, including the Taï National Park (where its type locality is[2][3]), Mont Péko National Park, and Mount Nimba World Heritage Site.[1]",

Ralph M. Rich (1916–1942) who was awarded the Navy Cross for his leadership as a fighter pilot off Enterprise during the Battle of Midway.\n\nRich was laid down on 27 March 1943 at the Defoe Shipbuilding Company, Bay City, Michigan, the third destroyer escort to be built at that yard. She was launched on 22 June 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Ralph McMaster Rich, widow of Lt. Rich.  Builder's trials before her pre-commissioning cruise were done in Lake Huron.\n\nAfter completion, Rich sailed from the builder's yard at Bay City to Chicago, Illinois, where they arrived on 24 September. From there, they went through the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal and down the Chicago River to Joliet, Illinois, where pontoons were attached to the ship so it could be pushed down the Des Plaines River, Illinois River, and Mississippi River as part of a barge train. After arriving at the Todd Johnson Shipyard in Algiers, Louisiana, on the west bank of the Mississippi at New Orleans, the rest of the crew reported aboard, and Rich was commissioned on 1 October 1943.\n\nFollowing shakedown off Bermuda, Rich was primarily engaged in coastal escort and patrol duty with Escort Division 19 (CortDiv 19) until the end of February 1944. At this time, CortDiv 19 consisted of the destroyer escorts Rich, Bull, Bunch, Bates, Amesbury, and Blessman. Then assigned to trans-Atlantic escort work, she completed three round-trip crossings by May. On 10 May 1944, Rich departed New York City in escort of a convoy to Britain in what would be her last transit of the North Atlantic.\n\nOn 23 May, she arrived at Derry, Northern Ireland, and awaited a convoy to escort back to the United States. Instead, Rich was assigned to the Normandy Invasion force, and commenced preparations for \"Operation Neptune\", the naval phase of the invasion of Normandy. She arrived at Plymouth, England on 4 June, and was assigned as an escort to the battleship Nevada.\n\nDelayed by weather for 24 hours, the \"U\" force sailed for France on 5 June, with Rich and her sister ship Bates in the screen of the bombardment group of Task Force 125 (TF 125), which consisted of the battleship Nevada and the heavy cruisers Quincy (CA-71), Tuscaloosa, and HMS Black Prince. From 6–8 June, she screened the heavier units as they supplied gunfire support for the troops landed on Utah Beach to the northwest of the Carentan Estuary. On 6 June, Rich laid down a smoke screen which foiled an attack by German E-Boat.\n\nSoon after 08:45 on 8 June, she was ordered by the Commander of Task Group 125.8 (TG 125.8) aboard Tuscaloosa to Fire Support Area 3 to assist the destroyer Glennon which had struck a mine northwest of the Saint-Marcouf Islands. Rich proceeded at full speed to the area, and then followed in the wake of two minesweepers to the immediate area of the Glennon. Closing Glennon, Rich dispatched a whaleboat, only to learn that her assistance was not needed at that point.  Rich then started to round the disabled ship and take up station ahead of the minesweeper which had taken Glennon in tow. She moved at slow speed, with extra hands on the lookout for enemy planes and mines.\n\nStaff, which was in the process of taking Glennon in tow, a mine exploded 50 yd (46 m) off Rich's starboard beam. This tripped circuit breakers, knocked out the ship's lighting, shook up the ship hard, and knocked sailors off their feet, but caused no structural damage. Within a minute, the engine room reported that they were \"ready to answer all bells\". Three minutes later, a second mine went off directly under the ship. Approximately 50 ft (15 m) of her stern was blown off, from frame 130 aft, just aft of the 1.1 in (28 mm) mount in 'X' position. Even though the blown-off stern section caught fire, survivors clung to her wreckage, and it sank shortly afterward. There was a 3 ft (0.91 m) sag in the main deck, and two torpedoes ran hot in their tubes. A third mine – another influence mine – exploded below the ice machine room forward, delivering the final blow two minutes later. The forward section was totally wrecked, the flying bridge demolished, and forward fire room severely damaged, and the mast came crashing down. Life rafts were ordered cut loose, and Rich was ordered abandoned. Several PT boats in a squadron commanded by Lt. Cdr. John D. Bulkeley came alongside Rich to take off personnel. All this time, they were being shelled by German shore batteries. A few minutes later, she sank in about 40 ft (12 m) of water at 49°31′N 1°10.6′W﻿ / ﻿49.517°N 1.1767°W﻿ / 49.517; -1.1767. Of her crew, 27 were killed, 73 were wounded, and 64 were missing; in all, 91 were killed outright or died of wounds following their rescue. Rich was the only American destroyer escort lost in the invasion force. Lt. Cdr. Edward A. Michel Jr. – who suffered a broken leg – was awarded the Navy Cross for extraordinary heroism in the incident.\n\nAfter the Normandy beachhead was no longer being actively used, machinery, guns, ammunition, and other equipment was salvaged from the wreck. After the war, the wreck was thoroughly stripped by scavengers. A few of her artifacts are on display at the Normandy D-Day Museum. One of her propellers is also on display in front of the museum.\n\nThis article incorporates text from the public domain Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships.

They are closely related to the Corethrellidae and Chironomidae; the adults are differentiated through peculiarities in wing venation.\n\nIf they eat at all, the adults feed on nectar. The larvae are aquatic and unique in their feeding method: the antennae of phantom midge larvae are modified into grasping organs slightly resembling the raptorial arms of a mantis, with which they capture prey. They feed largely on small insects such as mosquito larvae and crustaceans such as Daphnia. The antennae impale or crush the prey, and then bring it to the larval mouth, or stylet.\n\nThe larvae are nearly transparent, sometimes with a slightly yellow cast; their most opaque features are two air bags, one in the thorax, one in the abdomen about in the second last segment. The adults are delicate flies that closely resemble Chironomidae. Their antennae are 15-segmented and the females' antennae are somewhat bristly; the males' antennae, in contrast, are very plumose. In this respect, too, they resemble many of the Nematocera, and in particular the Chironomidae. The species vary in size from about 2 mm to 10 mm long in their adult stages.",

Derived from the more powerful of two Z 26 designs developed following the Disk, the Z 18 was first produced in 1925. The car was produced in a variety of body types, including a four seat open-top phaeton fitted with one, two and four doors, limousine and landaulet and a two-door roadster. It had a two-stroke two-cylinder 1,004 cc (61.3 in3) engine which enabled the car to reach a speed of 80 km/h (50 mph). A total of 2,510 vehicles were produced before production ceased in 1930.\n\nAfter the failure of the Disk, Zbrojovka was determined that its next car design would be a success. The company had a new engineering team that included the talented František Mackrle and he designed two new designs, both named Z 26, with different engine sizes.[1] The Board liked the more powerful version, but required the prototype to undergo rigorous testing, including driving over 9,200 kilometres (5,700 miles) across Europe, crossing the Dolomite and Alps and driving as far as Hamburg.[2] The car passed the tests and entered production as the 4/18 or Z 18 in 1925.[1]\n\nThe Z 18 had a rectangular frame with rigid axles.[2] The water cooled, two-stroke two-cylinder engine drove the rear wheels through a three speed gearbox. It had a bore of 80 mm (3+1⁄6 in) and stroke 100 mm (4 in), capacity of 1,004 cc (61.3 in3) and a Zenith carburettor.[3]\n\nThe standard car was fitted with 730 x 130 disc wheels, although more expensive versions had Rudge-Whitworth wire wheels. The basic body style was a four seat phaeton which cost 35,000 Kčs in 1926. It was open-top with a single door on the left, steering wheel on the right and a bench seat that was accessed by lowering the left front seat.[1]\n\nThe range of body types available increased over the car's production life. In September 1926, a limousine version was launched at the Prague Motor Show at a price of 40,500 Kčs.  This had a fixed roof with four side windows and more equipment, including an electric cigar lighter and coat hanger. A sports roadster was also available, priced at 45,000 Kčs.  Gradually over time, two and four door phaetons, landaulets and other custom designs were added to the range.[1] There was also a pickup truck capable of carrying a 500 kg (1,100 lb) payload.[4]\n\nThe Z 18 could reach a top speed of 80 km/h (50 mph) and had a typical fuel consumption of between 10 and 11 L/100 km (28 and 26 mpg‑imp; 24 and 21 mpg‑US).[1]",

Dixon (born 14 January 1977) is an English/Australian writer and film director. His directorial debut horror film Wrath was released in 2011,[1] the comedy Pictocrime (2004), which won best international feature and the LA film festival[2] and shorts Body in the Trunk (2006) and Phillip (2007).\n\nDixon was born in Bath, UK. He moved with his family to Andalusia, Spain when he was seven years old.[citation needed] Studying art and design he began working as a graphic artist and moved to Australia in his late teens.[citation needed]\n\nAfter graduating from Art college, Dixon began his career in marketing by working for a Japanese publishing house and spent time in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan.[citation needed] After several years he returned to Austria and hired a small film studio where he wrote, directed, edited, produced, and animated, \"Force Five\" a stop animation film.[citation needed] \"Force Five\" followed five secret agents who were part of C.E.N.T.E.R (Central Enforcement Network Targeting Evil Rogues) who would parachute into southern Bavaria during WW2 in order to kill the head of O.C.T.O (Official Crime & Terror Organisation). Dixon built the sets and designed the miniature characters by using remote control technology with mini servers in the characters heads.[citation needed] The movie was shot on a Bolex 16mm film camera.[citation needed] To fund his film he word work part-time for a SPFX company, building movie props and set pieces for Fox Studios.[citation needed]\n\nMoving to Sydney in 2001, Dixon began working on his first feature film. The story follows two brothers trapped inside a comic book and caught up in a scheme to blackmail the Devil out of his souls. Shot on super 16mm, the film premiered in Sydney and went on to win \"Best International Feature\" in LA.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2007 Dixon wrote the screenplay for Origin Unknown, a WW2 horror/creature movie that takes place in the catacombs of German-occupied Paris on 19 August 1944, the day of liberation. He produced and directed a 6-minute faux scene segment for it and began shopping it around the studios in Hollywood.[citation needed] While under the management of The Collective, in Beverly Hills, the film was being packaged and pre sold to foreign territories Dixon was signed to the Paradigm Talent Agency.[citation needed] Once the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 hit, many of the financiers were forced to back out of the project leaving it in limbo.[citation needed] After trying to resurrect it Dixon later signed with (WME) William Morris Endeavor to develop other projects.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2010, Dixon returned to Australia and began working on his next film Wrath, a horror film set in the Australian outback.[citation needed] A worldwide release was planned with Arclight Films but the deal fell apart and the movie was released internationally on DVD and Pay TV through Lightning Entertainment in 2011.[citation needed] The film starred Stef Dawson.",

The document emphasised a non-racial society, liberty and individual rights. The Freedom Charter remains the cornerstone of African National Congress policy and is seen by many as the foundation of South Africa's 1996 constitution.\n\nThe square has now been declared as a national heritage site. In June 2005, former President Thabo Mbeki lit a flame of freedom in Kliptown to mark the 50th anniversary of the Freedom Charter.[2] It is named after Walter Max Ulyate Sisulu, a political activist during the apartheid era who was a member of African National Congress and served as Secretary-General and Deputy President of the organisation. He was released from prison in 1989.\n\nThe square's features include an open-air museum that explains how the Freedom Charter was written as a collaborative effort by thousands of South Africans of all races.[3] The conical brick tower at the centre of the square is a monument to the document itself and contains the full principles of the Charter engraved in bronze.\n\nIn 2024 the Walter Sisulu Square  became a World Heritage Site, known as Nelson Mandela Legacy Sites.",

The Indiana Hoosiers won their second NCAA national championship with a 69–68 victory over the Kansas Jayhawks.\n\nTeams must take a free throw after a foul, as had been the practice through the 1938–39 season. Previously, under a rule that had been in effect since the 1939–40 season, a team could waive its free throw and instead take the ball at mid-court after a foul.[1]\n\nPrior to the season, the NCAA ruled that colleges and universities could no longer count games played against non-collegiate opponents in their annual won-loss records. Previously, it had been a common practice for many years for colleges and universities to include non-collegiate opponents in their schedules, with the games recognized as part of their official record for the season.[2]\n\nThe California Basketball Association began play, with five original members. It would be renamed the West Coast Athletic Conference in 1956 and the West Coast Conference in 1989.\n\nThe NCAA forced Kentucky to suspend its men's basketball program for the entire 1952–53 season as a result of the CCNY point-shaving scandal, which had been revealed in 1951.[3]\n\nBill Chambers of William and Mary grabbed 51 rebounds against Virginia on February 14, 1953, becoming the first player with more than 50 rebounds in one game.[4]\n\nBob Houbregs of Washington became the first player to score 40 or more points in an NCAA tournament Final Four game when he scored 42 against LSU in the national third-place game on March 18, 1953.[5]\n\nWalter Dukes of Seton Hall finished the season with 734 rebounds for the year, the first player to grab 700 rebounds in a single season.[4]\n\nA total of 44 college teams played as major independents. Among them, Seton Hall (31–2) finished with both the best winning percentage (.939) the most wins.[14]\n\nAlthough not considered a major independent during the season,[14] Southwest Missouri State (24–4) played as an independent[14] and was ranked No. 20 in  the season's final AP Poll.[15]",

It was released worldwide for the Wii in March 2009, and in Japan in February 2010. Although a commercial failure, MadWorld received generally positive reviews from critics. A spiritual successor, Anarchy Reigns, was released in 2012 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.\n\nJack impales a foe on a \"rose bush\", a wall of spikes. The game's graphics were inspired by, and have been compared to, Frank Miller's Sin City.\n\nMadWorld is divided into several levels representing different parts of Jefferson Island that have been converted into sets for the game show DeathWatch. The player progresses through these levels in a linear fashion during the first playthrough, but can revisit any completed level to attempt to score more points or take on a harder challenge.\n\nMost levels are open environments, allowing the player to explore them freely, although some sections of the level may require the player to earn a number of points before it will be accessible. A few levels feature motorcycle-based combat where the main character, Jack, is assaulted by foes as they race down a track or in a small arena. The player is challenged to beat the level's boss within a time limit, but in order to activate the boss fight, the player must accumulate enough points by defeating regular foes on the level. There are other challenges, bonuses, or mini-bosses that become active after the player accumulates enough points. A common feature of each of these levels is the \"Bloodbath Challenge\", a time-limited minigame that rewards the player for completing a specific type of activity with additional points. For example, the player may need to attempt to swing a bat at foes to knock them into a giant dartboard to score points, or to ensure foes are trapped in front of a speeding train. Outside of these challenges, the player is awarded points for every defeat of a foe. The number of points for beating foes increases by increasing the foe's power or using more unusual methods of winning. For example, while the player could throw an enemy on a wall, the player will earn significantly more points if they had previously forced a tire around the enemy.[6]\n\nThe player controls Jack from a third-person perspective using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk attachment for attacks and movement, respectively.[7] MadWorld does not make use of the Wii Remote's infrared sensor, as its developers found it unnecessary to pinpoint movements on the screen in order to attack.[8] When certain special attacks are possible, the player is prompted to press a button or move the controllers in a specific fashion to complete the action. In boss fights, the player must trigger special finishing moves that engage their foe in a series of quick time events in order to weaken, dismember attached weapons or defeat the boss, called Power Struggles. These are possible against certain normal enemies.\n\nThe game features extreme, over-the-top violence, but designer Shigenori Nishikawa intends it to be seen in a comical light despite the dark tone of the game.[9] For example, in a minigame called \"Man Darts\", players must hit enemies onto a giant dart board with a baseball bat to score points.[10] Because of the intended level of violence PlatinumGames was unsure of whether or not the game would ultimately be released in Japan, stating, \"In certain markets there are a lot of limitations on the amount of violence you can show, so we definitely have the Western market much more in mind.\"[11]\n\nMadWorld features highly stylized graphics that use a limited color palette of high contrast black and white with red, partially inspired by Frank Miller's Sin City graphic novels.[9]\n\nThree days before the game's event, the fictional Varrigan City became a target for a group of terrorists called \"The Organizers\", who severed the island city's transportation and communication ties with the rest of the world. They released a virus onto its population that would kill them in less than a day. However, the Organizers informed the populace that any person that killed another would receive the vaccine.\n\nThe city was quickly transformed into the stage of a recurring game show called DeathWatch, with announcers Howard \"Buckshot\" Holmes (Greg Proops) and former DeathWatch fighter Kreese Kreeley (John DiMaggio).[12] The remaining citizens of Varrigan City and new hopeful ones become the show's contestants, hoping to become the top-ranked fighter in the game and win a large cash prize.\n\nJack Cayman (Steve Blum), a man with a chainsaw attached to his prosthetic arm, enters the games and manages to gain sponsorship from \"Agent XIII\" (Jim Ward). The game's organizers, led by Noa (Dwight Schultz), know Jack's motive is more than just to win, and learn that Jack works with someone on the outside. They come to learn that Jack was a former marine, police officer, and rogue agent, but now seems intent on a mission. Noa surmises that Jack is after Naomi Ann Boris (Kate Higgins), the mayor's daughter working in the city. While they plan to kill Jack, they realize he became an audience favorite, with many sponsors and viewers betting on his success.\n\nMeanwhile, Jack meets Leo Fallmont (Danny Cooksey), a hospital doctor who was unwittingly trapped in the city but managed to obtain the vaccine. After telling Leo to stay low, Jack continues the mission. When Jack finds Naomi, he learns that she is the one watching the games and not getting in crisis. Jack leaves and continues to solve the case about the city's abnormal situation.\n\nMeanwhile, the Organizers realize Jack as the reigning champ, who quit the games by signing on to the Chasers. As Jack nears the last battle against the reigning-feigning champ, the Black Baron (Reno Wilson), Agent XIII reveals himself to be Lord Gesser, an influential figure in politics and knows that the DeathWatch games were created to cause the attack, but admits that this particular incarnation of the games is solely driven by someone's greed, and passes on the name of Springvale to Jack and the Agency, which quickly recognizes the name as a pharmaceutical company and that they were the silent hand that had built (in anticipation of DeathWatch) much of the sets for the games as soon as the Organizers had released the virus.\n\nAfter defeating the Black Baron at the end of the games, Jack blames Noa, who is shot and killed by Leo. After dealing with the armed forces, Jack disables the communication link with the Chasers and interrogates Leo. Leo tells Jack that his father was the president of Springvale Pharmaceuticals, who created both the virus and the vaccine, and was planning to use the televised DeathWatch event to show the effect of the virus as to blackmail anyone to pay for the vaccine under the outbreak. Leo admits that the company went bankrupt in the last presidential election and saw this route as the easiest way to recoup their losses. He is also at the games to be close to the action, fascinated by sports. Jack throws Leo off the tower to his death.\n\nMadWorld was created by PlatinumGames, a studio founded by former members of Capcom's Clover Studio, in their attempt to make a game that would be \"fun and attractive\" for the Wii, but that would also have a high level of violence that would make it unique for the system.[13][14] The game was produced by Atsushi Inaba, who had previously produced Viewtiful Joe, and directed by Shigenori Nishikawa, one of the designers of Resident Evil 4.[14] The developers chose violence as the main theme of the title, but experimented with a variety of cartoon-like art styles to alleviate the violent content with a sense of humor, ultimately deciding upon a black-and-white aesthetic with splashes of red for blood.[13][15] Inaba and Nishikawa acknowledged the influence of Frank Miller's Sin City in the work, but also noted they borrowed from both Western and Japanese comic book styles to create a unique style.[13][14][15] Comic-book style text and sound effects are also used in the game.[14] The main character, Jack, was designed to be \"big and tough\" rather than traditionally heroic, with an appearance that suggests he \"has been worn down by the world.\"[14]\n\nMadWorld was developed primarily for a Western audience, and the team extensively analyzed American pop culture in search of material that was so extreme and unrealistic it produced a comedic effect. Inaba played a variety of games, such as Manhunt 2, to see how they portrayed serious violence and to avoid making those same choices with MadWorld. Nishikawa chose to focus entirely on combat, omitting extraneous puzzle-solving or collection elements, with the goal of making the game easy to play in short sessions. The game's motion controls were designed to be as intuitive as possible, with Inaba reflecting that \"we've come to believe the Wii controller is actually more intuitive and more relevant for action games.\" An emphasis was placed on earning high scores, while \"Bloodbath Challenge\" minigames were used to incorporate additional variety into the game's design.[14]\n\nThe game was developed using Softimage for creation of the game's art, and a custom engine built to handle the art aesthetic and limitations of the Wii's memory. The game's sets are completely modeled with complex lighting features, but only normal maps are used to draw the game, avoiding the high-processing costs of light maps or layered textures.[13] This allowed the game's artists to have finer control of visibility and color balance in the game.[13] Though the developers attempted to add reflection mapping into the game, they found it did not fit well with the comic-book style and dropped it.[13] Explosions and other effects, normally created in other games using particle effects to achieve a factor of realism, were modeled with particles in MadWorld, but using specially-designed images to retain the comic book style.[13]\n\nTo overcome the lighting issues, the main character of Jack was modeled with two different textures, one used when he was in a bright area, and second used in dark areas that highlighted the main lines of the character's face.[13] Jack and other principal characters from the game were redesigned with the black-and-white features adjusted numerous times to make sure they did not simply blend into the background as the lesser enemies in the game.[13] Other characters were drawn and modeled to be as destructible as possible, with numerous versions of each character having missing limbs or other bodily harm. These were put together in 2000-frame animations that were then motion-captured; movement from one animation to another was blended out with the use of Hermite interpolation.[13] Blood spurts from each of the methods that Jack could use to kill a foe were each uniquely modeled to capture the appropriate trajectory for the type of injury, and often increasing the realistic amount of blood in order to make it stand out in the world.[13] The spatters of blood on the walls, floor, and other characters was modeled within the game using a collision detection system and a complex system for how the blood would interact with Jack's clothing.[13] Early builds of the game resulted in disorientation and eye strain due to the lack of colors. To avoid this, the developers limited the amount of on-screen movement and adjusted the game's textures to include more gradual changes from black to white.[13] While some of MadWorld relies on the Havok engine for modeling physical interactions in the game, the developers found they had to resort to their own programs to capture some of the reactions and behaviors of the enemies for many of the unique killing methods.[13]\n\nComparisons have been drawn between the game and Inaba's last project, God Hand, a comedy beat 'em up for the PlayStation 2. However, Inaba claims that while God Hand was developed for \"hardcore\" gamers, MadWorld is \"a lot easier to pick up.\"[15] The game's use of over-the-top violence was intentional to add humor to it.[15]\n\nThe game's story was written by Yasumi Matsuno, famous for his design in the Ogre Battle series and a number of Square Enix titles. Matsuno was given two opposing guidelines to writing the scenario.[16] While the development team ruled that violence should acceptable in the game's world, Inaba expressed his desire for violence to be \"denied in the end\" due to current views of violence in the video game industry. Matsuno combined the ideas for MadWorld's DeathWatch gameshow environment: violence is both accepted and required within the show, but not outside of it.[16]\n\nProops and DiMaggio, who had previously worked together on animated films such as Asterix and the Vikings and Kaena: The Prophecy, were both contacted by the voice cast director Jack Fletcher to play the parts of the announcers for the North American and European release. While most of their lines were already scripted, the two were able to ad-lib during recording, with some lines being retained in the final game.[17]\n\nThe music for the game was composed by Naoto Tanaka, PlatinumGames' in-house composer, along with four different local artists—Ox, Doujah Raze, Sick YG, and Bandy Leggz. Tanaka wanted to \"write in American style music and tried to avoid a true Japanese style\".[18] At the request of Inaba, the music styles included hip hop and rock, taking inspirations from the mashup album Collision Course from Linkin Park and Jay-Z.[18] Tanaka created the backtracks first using Cubase SX and ACID, then gave these, along with the general theme of the level associated with the music, to the artists for them to add lyrics and other performances. Tanaka received feedback from the American branch of PlatinumGames to refine the music to get the Western style down. Music was then assigned for the various stages and boss battles, requiring some revision of the existing works to make the music more apt for that stage of the game.[18] A total of 50 minutes of music was created for the game, and a soundtrack of the game's music was released along with the game in the United Kingdom and Australia.[18] The soundtrack was released in North America on June 30, 2009, by Sumthing Distribution.[19]\n\nNo.TitleArtistLength1.\"Get It Up\"Ox2:472.\"Come With It\"Doujah Raze2:353.\"Survival\"S.O.U.L.

It really is hard to be offended... because it's just so ridiculous.\"[23]\n\nOn March 10, the National Institute on Media and the Family issued a press release expressing its disappointment in Nintendo for allowing MadWorld to be released on the Wii.[24]\n\nReceptionAggregate scoresAggregatorScoreGameRankings83.07%[25]Metacritic81/100[26]Review scoresPublicationScore1Up.comA−[27]Computer and Video Games8/10[28]Edge6/10[29]Eurogamer7/10[30]Famitsu31/40[31]Game Informer9/10[32]GamePro[33]GameSpot7.5/10[34]GameSpy[35]GamesRadar+[36]GameTrailers8.5/10[37]Hyper9/10[38]IGN9/10[39]Nintendo Life9/10[40]Nintendo Power9/10[41]Nintendo World Report9/10[44]Official Nintendo Magazine85%[42]X-Play[43]\n\nMadWorld has received positive reviews from critics. In its April 2009 issue, Nintendo Power gave MadWorld a 9/10 rating. IGN gave the game a 9/10, praising the style, gameplay, and music, but criticizing the camera and short length, though it mentions that the hard difficulty level lengthens the game and increases the challenge considerably.[45]\n\nAbout.com felt the game was more flash than substance, giving it a 3/5 and stating: \"Divorced of its unique graphics and over-the-top presentation, this is actually a rather mediocre beat-em-up.\"[46] Game Informer disagreed, praising the deep combat system and arguing: \"for an amateur to become a talented executioner, you'll have to lash out creatively, prolonging your victim's death through multiple phases of pain. MadWorld runs the gamut in violence, taking an encyclopedic approach to its variety in kills. Some of the bloodletting will make you squirm uncomfortably.\"[32] IGN opined: \"MadWorld does not place emphasis on style over gameplay...there's plenty of fun, smart mechanics to back up the overwhelmingly slick look and sound of the title.\"[45] 1Up.com praised the motion controls stating, \"The immersive combat (aided by shockingly-fun Wii Remote and Nunchuk controls) would not have been as enjoyable if played on a traditional gamepad.\"[27]\n\nSean Ratcliffe, Vice President of Marketing for Sega of America stated that, in terms of sales, \"the first set of data for Madworld is very encouraging\".[47] The game sold around 66,000 copies in its first month of release in North America, according to The NPD Group.[48] These sales numbers have been used by market research firm OTX Research to justify their assertion that hype and marketing do not translate into sales figures; MadWorld, while commanding the \"highest level of unique interest\" based on user input at IGN, ranks 41st in OTX's sales metric for all Wii titles.[49] Sales of the game have reached 123,000 units in North America as of August 2009.[50][needs update] MadWorld fared much poorer in Japan, where it debuted at number 33 on Japanese sales charts and only selling around 3,000 units during its release week.[51]\n\nDespite low sales for both MadWorld and The House of the Dead: Overkill, Sega stated that it would continue to explore mature games for the Wii, according to Gary Dunn, a director at Sega Europe, noting that such games have a long tail in sales as such games become more discounted.[52] On January 4, 2010, it was announced that Sega would not publish any future M-rated video games for the Wii.[53] However, PlatinumGames announced a few days later that they would like to do a sequel to MadWorld,[54] which ended up as Anarchy Reigns, a 3D fighting game for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 that was released in 2012 in Japan and 2013 in western territories.[55][56][57]\n\nIn a 2019 interview, Inaba called MadWorld one of the most enjoyable projects he had worked on.[58][59] On March 10, 2020, PlatinumGames celebrated MadWorld's eleventh anniversary with new artwork of Jack created by lead character designer Masaki Yamanaka.[60][61]",

      "description": "\"Movin' On\"Single by CeCe Peniston featuring Suga T.from the album  I'm Movin' On B-side\"Remix\"Released\n\n\"Movin' On\" is a song by American musician CeCe Peniston, released on July 23, 1996, as the lead single from her third studio album, I'm Movin' On (1996). The track is produced by Dave Hall and charted at number twenty-nine on the US Billboard R&B chart. It also reached number 83 on the Billboard Hot 100. A remixed version of the song peaked at number ten on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart and entered the top 30 in Japan.\n\nLarry Flick from Billboard felt the song \"shows her finally fitting comfortably into the R&B sound that she has been cultivating over the past few years. Her booming voice now possesses the darker shades needed to hang tough in circles inhabited by such artists as Faith Evans and Mary J. Blige.\" Ha also noted that producer Dave \"Jam\" Hall contributes to Peniston's vocal confidence by placing her in \"a sleek, funk-fortified musical context that complements her phrasing style quite well.\"[3] Peter Miro from Cash Box stated that \"Movin' On\" \"kicks up a danceable groove that touches base with Peniston's solid club foundation, yet her emotive phrasing connects with a deeper soul reservoir this format merely hints at. Targeting new consumers, she's a firm fixture in the R&B camp henceforth. Guest artists G. Man and Suga T. flavor the best of the lot.\"[4]\n\n\"CeCe Peniston - Chart History\". Billboard.

      "name": "Psychological drama",
      "description": "Psychological drama, or psychodrama,[1] is a subgenre of drama and psychological fiction literatures that generally focuses upon the emotional, mental, and psychological development of the protagonists and other characters within the narrative, which is highlighted by the drama.[2][3][4] It is widely known as one of the main subgenres of psychological fiction; the subgenre is commonly used for films and television series.\n\nThe roots of the subgenre can be traced back to the early 20th century, emerging from a rich tapestry of literature that focused on the inner workings of the mind. As cinema evolved, filmmakers began to see the potential for the medium to explore complex psychological themes and narratives.[5]\n\nSimilar with these psychological genres, but rather than using imagery to provoke fear, suspense or terror, they utilize dramatic settings to elicit a strong, emotional value from audiences. Psychological dramas commonly deal directly with the psychological state and mental health, emphasize on emotional conflicts and often serve as a portrait of introspective personal struggle.[3]\n\nIt can be also characterized as primary character-driven, in which attention will be particularly paid to the psychology of the characters, to their intimate problems more than to the storyline context.[6] The characters are confronted with doubts, dilemmas or inner personality conflicts. The challenges they encounter will often force them to react, making them go through a whole psychological process during the film, even a metamorphosis.[7]\n\nIt often overlaps with other genres such as crime, fantasy, dark comedy, mystery and science fiction, and it is closely related with the psychological horror and psychological thriller genres. Psychological dramas use these genres' tropes to focus on the human condition and psychological effects, usually in a mature and serious tone, nearly similar to melodrama.\n\nThe difference between \"drama\" and \"psychological drama\" that places emphasis is that in the latter scenario, the focus is more on the psychological character of the characters and on existentialism in general, and not on the context of the narrative itself. So, the end is not necessarily tragic: the main character can doubt himself and sometimes overcome his intimate problems. Psychological drama can be very clearly distinguished from dramedy, as there is no to minimal humor in it like Good Will Hunting (1997) and The Truman Show (1998) but since the subgenre is rather devoid of humor.\n\nEach films utilize a range of techniques to mirror the psychological landscape of their characters. Close-ups and subjective camera angles invite viewers into the character’s personal space, while disjointed editing and surreal imagery can reflect fragmented states of mind. The use of symbolism is also prevalent, with objects, settings, and colors imbued with psychological significance. Music and sound design play crucial roles, often used to heighten the emotional intensity and draw audiences deeper into the psychological experience.[5]\n\nThese primary themes in the subgenre related to depiction of mental illness, psychological trauma, and society, but not limited to; other themes like alienation, self-doubt, and the quest for identity are common, with narratives often blurring the lines between reality and illusion to reflect the turmoil within the characters’ minds.[5]\n\nIt can be explore thematic elements include: denialism, depression, disability, distorted sequences, dysfunctional relationships, existential crisis, human sexuality, identity crisis, mass hysteria, mood swings, odd behaviors, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychological abuse, psychedelic art, and social issues.[8]\n\nPsychological drama films have generally rooted with traditional drama genre in the earliest years of 20th century, with these examples cited The Whispering Chorus (1918)[10] and Greed (1924).[11] Additionally, early examples of popular subgenre films in 1930s to 1950s include La vuelta al nido (1938),[12] Death of a Salesman (1951),[13] Johnny Belinda (1948),[14] A Place in the Sun (1951),[15] and The Snake Pit (1948)[16]\n\nSeveral films generally used the subgenre have employed controversially social issues and/or psychosexual themes, most notably Stanley Kubrick's Lolita (1962),[17] A Clockwork Orange (1971), and Eyes Wide Shut (1999).[18] Other acclaimed films with similar themes including Last Tango in Paris (1972),[19] One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975),[20][21] The Ninth Configuration (1980),[22] Pink Floyd - The Wall,[23] Sophie's Choice (both 1982)[24] Heavenly Creatures (1994),[25] Breaking the Waves (1996),[26] I Stand Alone (1998), Magnolia (1999), Requiem for a Dream (2000),[27] The Piano Teacher (2001), Elephant (2003),[24] Enter the Void (2009),[28] Biutiful (2010),[29] Shame (2011),[30] Jagten[31] and The Master (both 2012),[32] Nymphomaniac (2013),[26] Whiplash (2014),[33][24] The Power of the Dog (2021),[34][35][36] and Blonde and The Whale (both 2022).[37]\n\nFilms have some thematically-linked franchises or trilogies to focus on aspects of human condition and psychological elements, notably Iñárritu's Death trilogy (consists Amores perros (2000), 21 Grams (2003) and Babel (2006)) and Krzysztof Kieślowski's Three Colours trilogy.\n\nAsian films have contributed the subgenre, often employs several psychological and social elements. For example: Akira Kurosawa, a Japanese renowned filmmaker, known for his landmark filmography with the subgenre, notably Drunken Angel (1948)[28] and Ikiru (1952).[38] Each films including The Demon (1978), Batch '81 (1982), Silip (1986), Taare Zameen Par (2007), Himizu (2011),[39] Aparisyon (2012),[40] Like Father, Like Son and Norte, the End of History (both 2013), Black Stone (2015), Last Night (2017), and Family History and John Denver Trending (both 2019).\n\nAnimated series are examples of this subgenre only focuses on characters' experience with mental health and psychological trauma; these included Bojack Horseman,[50] Morel Orel, Steven Universe Future,[51][52] and Undone.Japanese filmmaker and animator Hideaki Anno created Neon Genesis Evangelion.Japanese filmmaker and animator Hideaki Anno, who is best known of creating anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion, a notorious example of the subgenre, delves into heavy psychological elements in its latter half of the entire series.[53][54] The anime series was the subject to acclaim and controversy, especially for the latter centered on its final two episodes; this was resulted to reboot a feature film as an alternative ending.\n\nAdditionally, some anime series employed in psychological elements including Akagi,[55] The Flowers of Evil,[56] The Fruit of Grisaia[57], Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai[58], Scum's Wish[59][60], The Tatami Galaxy[61], Welcome to the N.H.K.,[62] and Wonder Egg Priority.[63]\n\nA Silent Voice,[64] Anomalisa, It's Such a Beautiful Day, Inside Out (and its sequel), The Missing, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, and When Marnie Was There[65] are among the examples of animated films used in the subgenre, usually having the characters' portrayal dealt with several themes such as anxiety attack, fear of abandonment and death, and society.\n\nAdam Elliot is the most notable example of animated psychological drama films, confronted with bitterness and human conditions. His films included Harvie Krumpet (2003),[66] Mary and Max (2009),[67][68] and Memoir of a Snail (2024).\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson - An American filmmaker known for his depictions of flawed characters and exploration of subjects and themes such as dysfunctional families, alienation, loneliness and redemption.\n\nSofia Coppola - An American filmmaker, daughter of Francis Ford Coppola, known for psychological drama films about isolation and society.\n\nTodd Field -  An American filmmaker well known of his filmography introduced with psychologically-mind characters and themes.\n\nAlejandro González Iñárritu - A Mexican filmmaker who has directed numerous films that focus on aspects of the human condition.\n\nCharlie Kaufman - An American director and screenwriter, whose work explores universal themes like identity crisis, mortality, and the meaning of life through a metaphysical or parapsychological framework.\n\nAndrei Tarkovsky - A Soviet and Russian filmmaker, known for his philosophical and psychological movies dealing with existence, faith and dreamlike memories.",

      "name": "Wismar affair",
      "description": "The Wismar affair refers to the political discussions over the status of the town of Wismar between 1796 and 1903. Wismar was leased to Mecklenburg-Schwerin from Sweden for a sum of 1,250 000 riksdalers. The lease was supposed to last every 100 years, whereafter Sweden (later the United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway) would possess the right to redeem the city. However, as the German Empire rose throughout the 19th century, the possibility of Sweden demanding the return of the territory seemed more and more unlikely as King Oscar II would not like to challenge a great power. Furthermore, the rent of the loan had grown to 96 million kronor, an amount that Stockholm was not too enthusiastic to pay. As 1903 came, the German and Swedish diplomats met in Stockholm to discuss the future of the town. Oscar II would agree to sign the treaty of Stockholm which stipulated the waving of all Swedish claims on the city.\n\nWismar first came under Swedish rule as the soldiers of Gustavus Adolphus marched into the city in 1632 during the Thirty Years War.[1] However, the city (including the surrounding territories of Neukloster and Poel) became a De-jure part of Sweden due to the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648.[1][2] However, the territories were somewhat neglected in favor of the bigger and more profitable Swedish-German territory of Pomerania.[3] Wismar did however remain an important Mecklenburgan trading city well into the 18th century.[3]\n\nIn 1796, Gustav IV of Sweden divorced Luise Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Her father, Duke Friedrich Franz, was outraged and demanded Wismar as compensation.[4][2][3][5] Friedrich appealed to the Danish court for mediation where it was decided that a sum of 100,000 Riksdalers would be paid by Sweden as compensation (6,000 every year).[3][5] However, Mecklenburg-Swcherin's desire to take control over Wismar persisted regardless as Mecklenburg diplomats attempted to persuade Russia to support them in the matter in 1797.[3][5] The Tzar assured Friedrich that Russia would not hesitate to support Mecklenburg-Schwerin in a defensive war but refused to support any aggressive expansion into the city.[3] Failing to gain the support of Russia, August von Lützow was instead tasked with securing a deal with Sweden to buy Wismar.[4][3] The Swedes had themselves tried in vain to sell the territory to Prussia just a few years earlier.[3] Lützow met with the Swedish general Von Toll in Russia and managed to make him agree to bring up the matter when he returned home.[3][4] Although Gustav IV was fond of the idea of selling Wismar to Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the negotiations on the stipulations of the handover would drag on.[4][3] Eventually, on the 26th of June, the respective sides would both sign the Treaty of Malmö which stipulated that Sweden would lease the territory to Wismar in exchange for a loan of 1,250 000 Riksdalers and the Swedish crown would sell all of their possessions and estates in the city.[4][3][5][2] Furthermore, Sweden would have the right to redeem the territory every 100 years in exchange for the return of the loan.[5] Sweden would also no longer have the right to collect customs of merchants passing by Wismar.[4]\n\nThroughout the rest of the 19th century, Wismar had a special status as a half German half Swedish city as they maintained their\n\nown laws and their own flag.[5][2] German intellectuals in Wismar speculated if Sweden (As a part of Sweden-Norway) would ever use their right to claim overlordship over the city to reclaim some remnants of the now long gone Swedish Empire.[5] However, Mecklenburg-Schwerin had as of the 18th of August 1866 been a part of the North German Confederation which later in 1871 expanded south forming the German Empire. These developments meant that if Sweden-Norway would ever try to demand the return of the city, they would have to enter a dispute with a great power.[5] Furthermore, Germany appeared as if they were planning to keep the city as Wismar was finally included in the diet of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in 1897.[6]\n\nAs 1903 came, King Oscar II of Sweden decided not to redeem the city.[1][4] The rent of the 1803 loan had grown to 96 million Kronor, an amount that Sweden-Norway was not too keen on paying.[4][2] Furthermore, it was evident that Germany would never accept the loss of Wismar, especially to a weak nation like Sweden-Norway. Oscar II was scared that a political crisis would erupt if Sweden-Norway insisted on the city's return.[5] Such a crisis could hurt the Swedish-Norwegian position in Europe as it would likely cause tensions with Germany.[5] The Swedish Riksdag was also of the opinion that Wismar should remain German and would support Oscar II in his decision as was the Swedish writer Carl Lundin who argued that Sweden never could keep Wismar long term.[4]\n\n\"attnågon inlösning af panten aldrig skulle komma i fråga, utan öfverlåtelsen vara gjord för evärdliga tider, därom var man fullkomligt ense och därom hade icke heller under de preliminära förhandlingarna rådt någon meningsskiljaktighet.\n\n\"The redeeming of the city will never be taken into consideration, the transfer of the city was done to last as proven by the fact that both the Germans and the Swedes were in complete unity and had not even maintained different proposals of what is to be done with the city during the preliminary negotiations.\"— Carl Lundin\n\nGerman and Swedish-Norwegian diplomats would meet in Stockholm to discuss the matter and they would agree to sign the 1903 Treaty of Stockholm on the 23rd of June, almost exactly 100 years after the Treaty of Malmö.[4] The treaty stipulated the relinquishing of all Swedish claims upon Wismar including their right to redeem the city every 100 years.[3][5][4]\n\nAs Sweden-Norway dropped all claims on the city, Wismar formally was not a part of any country. It wasn't until Duke Freidrich IV marched into the city later that year[a] to claim it for the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin that the city became finally German.[5][2] He was joined by a 2,800-person big parade as well as 21 carriages 86 kavalry men and 160 horses.[2]\n\nDue to the transfer of Wismar to Germany in 1903, a memorial was erected called the \"Schwedenstein\" (English: Sweden stone) which features the coat of arms of Sweden, Mecklenburg, and Wismar.[7] The stone was also erected due to the 100-year anniversary of the Treaty of Malmö.[7] Traces of the Swedish era still remain in Wismar, notably in the form of the annually celebrated Schwedenfest (English: Sweden fest) every August.[7][1] Furthermore, Wismar maintains ties to Sweden by being a twin city with Kalmar.[8]",

      "description": "Ralf Meister (born 5 January 1962 in Hamburg-Neugraben)[1] is a German Lutheran theologian, former General Superintendent (regional bishop) of Berlin,[2] and Landesbischof of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Hanover.[3]\n\nMeister studied at the University of Hamburg and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem Theology and Jewish Studies.[1] He was ordained at St. Michaelis Church, Hamburg on 28 May 1992.[1] In September 2001 he became Provost of the Lübeck district of the North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church. On Pentecost 2008 he was invested as General Superintendent of Berlin at the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church,[2] succeeding Martin-Michael Passauer, who retired. On 25 November 2010 the Synod of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Hanover elected Meister as Landesbischof, winning 64 of 76 votes in the second round. Meister's investment as bishop will be held at the Marktkirche in Hanover on 26 March 2011.[1] He succeeded Margot Käßmann who stepped down as Landesbischof on 24 February 2010.\n\nOn 22 January 2005 he gave the \"Wort zum Sonntag\" on the German national television for the first time.[2][4]\n\nRalf Meister is married to Dagmar Ulrich-Meister and has three children, Juval, Lotta and Tom-Lasse.[1]\n\nIn early 2024, Meister came under criticism after it had become known that the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Hanover had not evaluated the personnel files as contractually agreed for the large-scale ForuM study on the processing of sexual violence in the Protestant Church in Germany (EKD), but only the disciplinary files.[5] In March 2024, Meister was criticized again after the presentation of a scientific report on the way the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Hanover dealt with a survivor of sexual violence. This report showed that even after 2010, the year in which many survivors of German churches spoke out, Meister’s church tried not to further process the case.[6] The survivor contacted Meister’s church repeatedly, but to no avail and was turned away.[7] This survivor of the Oesede case demanded Meister's resignation which Meister, however, refused, claiming he had searched his conscience thoroughly. He stated that sexualized violence abuse was not the only issue in his church ad referred that there were positive developments in the church which he then claimed were results of his actions.[7] During a press conference in March 2024, Meister admitted that he had prevented contact with survivors of sexual violence in the past.[8] At the beginning of June 2024, more than 200 pastors and other church employees signed an open letter criticizing Meister's handling of sexual abuse cases.[9] In June 2024, the a survivors’ initiative named “Meisterhafte Vertuschung beenden” - a wordplay on Meister’s surname, meaning “end the masterly cover-up”' called for his resignation.[10] [11] In July 2024, the regional church revised the number of victims of sexual violence upwards from 140 to 190 and admitted that more cases were known than had been previously communicated. In fact, survivors themselves had discovered through inspection of files that the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Hanover had not included all cases that were known to it in the official statistics and in the ForuM study. More survivors joined the initiative \"End the Masterful Cover-up\" and also called for Ralf Meister's resignation.[12] The Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Hanover also admitted that victims of sexual violence who had contacted the regional church with information in the past were regularly turned away.[13]\n\nAuthority control databases InternationalISNIVIAFWorldCatNationalGermanyIsraelPeopleDeutsche BiographieDDB",

      "description": "Born into a clerical family at his father's manse on 7 May 1825, he was the eldest son, in a family of 13 children, of Matthew Leishman, D.D., minister of Govan,  leader of the middle party in the secession controversy of 1843; his mother was Jane Elizabeth Boog, and a brother, William Leisham, became professor of midwifery at Glasgow. Educated first at Govan, he went to Glasgow High School and Glasgow University, graduating M.A. in 1843. After the usual course at the Divinity Hall, he was licensed as a probationer by the presbytery of Glasgow on 7 February 1847, and became assistant minister at Greenock.[1]\n\nFrom 1852 to 1855 Leishman served the parish of Collace, near Perth, and from 1855 till 1895 that of Linton, Teviotdale, in the presbytery of Kelso. He was among the first to join the Church Service Society founded in 1865, reflecting his views on church matters, and in 1866 he became a member of its editorial committee, where he collaborated with George Washington Sprott.\n\nHe proceeded D.D. from Glasgow University with a thesis on A Critical Account of the Various Theories of the Sacrament of Baptism (Edinburgh, 1871).[1]\n\nIn bad health, Leishman spent the winter of 1876–7 in Spain and Egypt, and investigated Mozarabic and Coptic service-books. In 1882 he joined Sprott and others in a formal protest against the admission by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland of two congregational ministers to the status of ordained ministers; the precedent was not acted on again. In 1892 he helped William Milligan to found the Scottish Church Society; he contributed papers to its conferences, and three times (1895-6, 1902–3, and 1905–6) acting as its president. He was moderator of the General Assembly of 1898, where Frederick Temple spoke for temperance; the speeches of both Temple and Leishman were published in a pamphlet.[1]\n\nLeishman's third son, James Fleming, was ordained to succeed him at Linton (7 March 1895), and Leishman then moved to Edinburgh. There he died on 13 July 1904, and was buried at Linton. At Hoselaw, in a remote comer of the parish where Leishman used to conduct cottage services, a chapel was erected by public subscription to his memory in 1906. A. K. H. Boyd called him \"the ideal country parson\".[1]\n\nIn 1868 Sprott and Leishman published an annotated edition of The Book of Common Order, commonly called \"Knox's Liturgy\", and the Directory for the Public Worship of God agreed upon by the Assembly of Divines at Westminster, which became a standard authority. In 1875, he published a plea for the observance by the Church of Scotland of the five major Christian festivals, entitled: May the Kirk keep Pasche and Yule? \"Why not\", he answered in the words of John Knox, \"where superstition is removed\".[1]\n\nTo a work in four volumes, The Church of Scotland Past and Present, edited by Robert Herbert, Leishman contributed a section on \"The Ritual of the Church of Scotland\". He defined his ecclesiastical position in The Moulding of the Scottish Reformation (Lee lecture for 1897); 'The Church of Scotland as she was, and as she is' (John Macleod Memorial lecture for 1903); in an address on The Vocation of the Church at the Church of Scotland Congress, 1890, and in lectures on pastoral theology which were delivered by appointment of the general assembly at the four Scottish universities, 1895–7. He contributed to the Church Service Society's series of Scottish liturgies and orders of divine service, an edition with introduction and notes of the Westminster Directory (Edinburgh, 1901).[1]\n\nLeishman married, on Lady Day 1857, his cousin, Christina Balmanno Fleming, who died on 15 June 1868. Five sons and two daughters survived him.[1]\n\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Lee, Sidney, ed. (1912). \"Leishman, Thomas\".

Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (April 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\n\nAt 11:30 on the morning of May 7, 2009, a Presidential Guard battalion led by General Toufa Abdoulaye ambushed a column of UFR rebels on the eastern outskirts of Am Dam, a village 100 kilometers south of Abéché in southeastern Chad. Mounted infantry from both sides exchanged fire from the backs of Toyota “technicals” mounted with heavy weapons. One eyewitness saw anti-aircraft weapons used against targets on the ground. Am Dam’s hospital sustained severe damage when a government vehicle offloading casualties drew fire from rebels forces, which also destroyed 14 civilian structures in the vicinity with errant shells. According to hospital workers, government soldiers returned fire and promptly withdrew.\n\nLess than an hour after the skirmish began, rebel vehicles that were passing to the south of Am Dam in an attempt to flank the smaller government force encountered an armored column of government reinforcements led by Hassan al Gadam al-Djineddi, chief of staff of the Chadian National Army, and General Tahir Ardah, general director of the Gendarmerie Nationale. The rebel flanking movement was eliminated, and by 2:30 the remnants of the UFR column was racing back to safe havens in Darfur, with government forces in hot pursuit.\n\nOfficial tallies later released by the government testified to the intensity of the fighting, with 247 combatants killed, 225 of them rebels.  Of the 212 rebels taken into custody, 83 were minors.\n\nWith government control firmly established, soldiers broke into the hospital pharmacy and commandeered medical supplies. Civilian volunteers in Am Dam and the adjacent village of Am Dam Zeribe were organized into six teams of volunteers to collect and bury the dead. One burial committee encountered 11 rebel corpses, seven of whom had an entry wound in the forehead or between the eyes. One government soldier was found with his eyes gouged out.\n\nGovernment soldiers conducting security sweeps in Am Dam and surrounding villages for wounded rebels pursued a group of insurgents to the village of Galbassa, two kilometers east of Am Dam, where four rebels took refuge in a home that was occupied by six civilians. Government soldiers supported by a T-55 tank drew within five meters of the structure and ordered the civilians to leave. Five civilians emerged, with two rebels in their midst. Both rebels were killed by government soldiers and three of the five civilians suffered gunshot wounds, including a 14-year-old boy. The structure from which they had emerged was then deliberately flattened, killing the two remaining rebels and crushing to death Youssouf Abakar, a 55-year-old civilian and the father of eight children. Abakar was one of 15 civilians killed during the combat.\n\nGovernment soldiers remained in the Am Dam area for six days, during which the nearby hamlet of Mashangala was systematically looted of its valuables. In the early evening of May 7, government soldiers entered Galbassa under the pretense of searching for rebels and sexually assaulted two sisters, a 19-year-old woman and a 14-year-old girl. The women of Galbassa evacuated the village the following morning, going to the nearby towns of Gasdjamoudes and Habanier. They did not return until government forces withdrew from the area.\n\nIn May 2009, simultaneous with the UFR raid on Am Dam, the Front Populaire pour la Renaissance Nationale (FPRN), a Chadian rebel group led by Adoumj Yacoub, occupied the strategic town of Tissi at the tri-point of Chad, Sudan, and the Central African Republic. Chadian government forces wouldn't retake the city until April 2010.",

The groups, who were big names in the UK pop music scene in the late 1990s and early 2000s, reunited for the ITV2 reality-documentary series The Big Reunion (apart from Blue, who had already been reunited since 2011), a show which follows them meeting again for the first time in a decade and rehearsing ahead of their comeback performance.\n\nAlthough the bands were initially only to perform a single concert at London's Hammersmith Apollo on 26 February 2013, high demand for tickets and the popularity of the series led to a full arena tour being announced. The arena tour consisted of 14 shows that took place during May 2013, although Blue only performed at four of these shows due to their own tour commitments. A leg called \"Christmas Party Tour\" was later announced with seven gigs in December 2013.\n\nOn 18 October 2012, it was announced that pop groups Five, 911, Atomic Kitten, B*Witched, Honeyz and Liberty X—who were big names in the UK pop music scene in the mid-to-late 1990s and early 2000s—would be reuniting for an ITV2 documentary series and a comeback performance at some point in 2013.[1][2]\n\nOn 21 February 2013, it was revealed that a seventh band, Blue, would be joining The Big Reunion gig as well.[3] When asked why they chose to join The Big Reunion, Blue said: \"Phil Mount, the Big Reunion's producer, has always been a long time supporter of the band, giving us our first TV break, he really wanted us to be surprise special guests announced halfway through the series and to perform on the Hammersmith Apollo show. This sounded like a lot of fun, giving us the perfect chance to perform together again in the UK for our fans and reconnect with the other acts, many of whom friends of ours and started out around the same time as us. For us the 'Big Reunion' is a great chance for all of us bands to come together for one BIG party on Tuesday night!\"[4]\n\nThe bands were originally only supposed to perform a one-off concert at London's Hammersmith Apollo on 26 February 2013, but when the entire show sold out in under five minutes shortly after the premiere of the first episode on 31 January 2013, rumours circulated that the show may become a full arena tour around the UK.[5] On 11 February, it was confirmed that, following high ticket demands and the popularity of The Big Reunion, a full 12-date UK tour would be taking place from 3–14 May 2013.[6] On 14 February shows were added in Dublin and Belfast, bringing the tour to a total of 14 shows.[7] Blue will only be taking part in four of the 14 shows due to headlining their own arena tour.[8]\n\nOn 27 March 2013, it was announced that the bands would perform a mini Christmas tour in December 2013.[9] Five, Atomic Kitten, B*Witched, 911, Honeyz and Liberty X will all be taking part, but Blue will not as they will be headlining their own comeback tour.[10] Three additional shows were announced on 23 April 2013.[11]\n\nThe original Hammersmith Apollo show in February was recorded and parts of the concert, as well as backstage footage, aired on ITV2 on 28 March 2013 as The Big Reunion finale.[12] The full concert was also released on DVD on 1 April 2013.[13]\n\nAlmost 4,000 people attended the sold-out show at the Hammersmith Apollo on 26 February, for which tickets sold out almost immediately after going on sale. The entire 14-date arena tour quickly sold out as well.\n\nThe arena tour has received highly positive reviews from critics. Denise Evans gave the show in Manchester on 4 May, four out of five stars. \"It was like watching a Smash Hits Poll Winners Party of old or an episode of Top of the Pops, which ultimately is exactly what the majority people singing and dancing along in the arena wanted. A bit of nostalgia.\", she said.[21] After attending the show in Nottingham on 10 May, Jayne Garfitt of thisisnottingham.com said \"When it comes to revisiting the bands of your childhood the experience tends to tread a thin line between legendary and tragic. But that was not the case with the Big Reunion Tour. From the minute 5ive stepped on stage to the opening bars of Queen's \"We Will Rock You\", the atmosphere at the Capital FM Arena was electric. They might all be older and wiser but there is no doubt that these bands still have what it takes – slick dance moves, catchy lyrics and a great big sense of fun. Brilliant.\"[22]",

      "name": "Zonda wind",
      "description": "Zonda wind (Spanish: viento zonda) is a regional term for the foehn wind that often occurs on the eastern slope of the Andes, in Argentina.\n\nThe Zonda is a dry wind (often carrying dust) which comes from the polar maritime air, warmed by descent from the crest, which is approximately 6,000 m (20,000 ft) above sea level. It may exceed a velocity of 240 km/h (150 mph).\n\nThe Zonda wind is produced by the northeastward movement of polar fronts, and although it is hot and dry at the low-lands, it is the main mechanism for snow precipitation at the high altitude chains, where it looks as viento blanco, reaching speeds sometimes over 200 km/h. Thus, instead of being a snow-eater, this wind is particularly important for this arid region, as it is connected to the buildup of the winter snow cover and accumulation over the scarce local glaciers.\n\nWhile this type of föhn wind may occur over most central parts of western Argentina, its effects are more impressive in La Rioja, San Juan, and northern Mendoza provinces, where the mountain barrier (the Andes) is higher, while to the north the Puna plateau dissipates these winds.\n\nAccording to studies (conducted over the period 1967–1976), the Zonda wind most commonly starts during the afternoon (between 12 and 6 PM), and tends to last between 1 and 12 hours, though it may present itself intermittently for as long as 2 or 3 days. It is countered usually by the entrance of cold air masses moving northwestward (viento sur). In 90% of the cases, the phenomenon takes place between May and November.\n\nThe term zonda also describes a hot, humid north wind in the Pampas, in advance of a depression moving eastwards, and preceding the pampero. This wind is also called the sondo.\n\n(in Spanish) MeteoBlogs – Viento Zonda. National Meteorological Service, Air Regions Command, Argentine Air Force.",

      "description": "Fleischmann's Yeast is an American brand of yeast founded by Hungarian-American businessman Charles Louis Fleischmann. It is currently owned by Associated British Foods and is sold to both consumer and industrial markets in the United States and Canada.\n\nThe yeast is available in a number of different forms with various qualities and intended uses. Fleischmann's is also a brand name of corn oil margarine.\n\nThe company was founded by Hungarian Jews Charles Louis Fleischmann, his brother Maximilian, and James Gaff in Riverside, Cincinnati, in 1868,[1] as Gaff, Fleischmann & Company. They exhibited their yeast at the 1876 Centennial Exposition. After Gaff's death in 1881, the name was changed to Fleischmann and Company, and then The Fleischmann Company in 1905.[2]\n\nIn 1924, the brothers' nephew Raoul Fleischmann, using the wealth generated by the family business, provided the funding for the launch of The New Yorker with his friend Harold Ross. Raoul invested $700,000 before the magazine became profitable, and he was the magazine's publisher until his death in 1969.[3]\n\nIn 1929, the company was merged into Standard Brands by J.P. Morgan, and that same year the company began the sponsorship of the musical variety radio program, The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour starring Rudy Vallée.[4]\n\nIn the 1930s, the company's advertisements highlighted \"intestinal fatigue\", a condition said to be brought on by the pressures of modern civilization. The ads claimed that Fleischmann's Yeast was an effective treatment for the condition, despite protests by the American Medical Association.[5] In 1936, Consumer Reports disputed Fleischmann Yeast's advertising claims that it cured constipation and acne.[6]\n\nDuring the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in March and for subsequent months, Fleischmann's struggled to meet surging demand for its products, as house-bound consumers sought to produce more of their own baked goods. The company faced shortages of raw materials and the lengthy process of yeast production limited production.[10]\n\nCommon forms of yeast Fleischmann's make are: (i) cubes or \"cakes\" of compressed fresh yeast wrapped in foil, an original form of packaged yeast that is soft and perishable; (ii) packets of Active Dry Yeast, a shelf stable granular yeast invented by Fleischmann during World War II; (iii) packets of RapidRise yeast intended to reduce dough rising time by as much as 50% by bypassing the first rise; (iv) bread machine yeast, an instant yeast sold in a glass jar; and (v) pizza crust yeast, an instant yeast packaged with enzymes and dough relaxers such as L-Cysteine intended to add pliability to dough and reduce the amount of time needed to make a fresh pizza crust.[11]\n\nFleischmann's Active Dry Yeast is the best-known of their yeast products due to its extended shelf life compared to fresh yeast.",

      "description": "James WillingBorn1750 (1750)Philadelphia, Province of Pennsylvania, British AmericaDied1801 (aged 50–51)OccupationMerchantKnown forWilling ExpeditionParent(s)Charles WillingAnne Shippen WillingRelativesThomas Willing (brother)\n\nJames Willing (1750–1801) was a representative of the American Continental Congress who led a 1778 military expedition during the American Revolutionary War. Known as the Willing Expedition, the effort involved raiding British forts, plantations, and other properties of loyalists in the colonial British West Florida settlement of Natchez. Later that year, he sought protection from the British by hiding out in New Orleans, but was taken prisoner by them on his attempt to return to Philadelphia.\n\nJames Willing came from a prominent family in Philadelphia. His father was Charles Willing, who twice served as mayor of Philadelphia, and his mother Anne Shippen was the granddaughter of Edward Shippen, who was the second mayor of Philadelphia. His older brother Thomas Willing was an American merchant and a delegate to the Continental Congress from Pennsylvania, and the first president of the First Bank of the United States.[1]\n\nIn his early life, Willing was a merchant and operated a general store in the colonial British West Florida settlement of Natchez.[2] During the American Revolution, the majority of the population of Natchez remained loyal to the British crown. Willing was not a successful merchant and returned to Philadelphia, where he was commissioned as a naval captain in the Continental Navy.[3]\n\nIn 1777, as a representative of the Continental Congress, Willing traveled to Natchez to try to convince the residents to join the American movement for independence. While he was graciously received, his proposal was rejected. The landowners were indebted to the king for granting them property and allowing them a form of representative government. Willing reported back to the Continental Congress that \"West Florida was a serious threat to the cause of independence\".[4]\n\nOliver Pollock and Bernardo de Gálvez, the Governor of Spanish Louisiana and Commander of the troops of his Catholic Majesty began organizing military raids against British West Florida and sent over US$70,000 worth of munitions to Fort Pitt.[5] Pollock received a letter from Robert Morris and William Smith who were members of the Committee of Secret Correspondence stating that Willing would be leading an expedition against loyalist settlements along the river above New Orleans. Pollock and George Rogers Clark raised funds to financially support the military expedition.[6] Willing along with twenty-nine men of the 13th Virginia Regiment left Fort Pitt on January 11, 1778 and sailed down the Ohio River on board the gunboat USS Rattletrap.[7]\n\nWilling and his party reached Natchez on February 19, 1778, and began raiding British forts, plantations, and other properties of British loyalists.[8] On February 21,[9] Willing forced the residents of Natchez to take an oath of allegiance to the United States of America. Those who swore the oath (the signatories included William Hiern, Charles Percy, and plantation owner Samuel Wells) agreed not to take up arms against the United States of America, in exchange for assurances that the people they enslaved would not be seized nor freed, and that Willing would treat with Choctaws nearby to prevent attacks.[10][11][12] Willing continued to plunder and raid the countryside during the period known as the Willing Expedition.[8] He and his party looted property with an estimated worth of $1.5 million.[13] By May 24 his efforts were exhausted and he retreated to New Orleans for protection from the British.[9]\n\nA few months after this, Pollock paid for Willing to return to Philadelphia by ship, but Willing's ship was intercepted by the British off the coast of Delaware.[14] He was taken prisoner and held in New York.[14] It is unclear how long he was held. DuVal says he was held for \"a year or so\",[14] while Haynes asserts that the British conducted a prisoner exchange on September 3, 1781, exchanging Willing for a captured British officer.[15] However, a note on Willing's company's muster roll in 1782 indicates that Willing was absent, suggesting that he was still a prisoner of the British.[16]\n\nWilling was living in Haverford Township, Pennsylvania, at the end of his life. He died there in 1801.[17]\n\n\"Expedition of Captain James Willing\". The American Monthly Magazine. 20. The National Society. 1902.\n\nDeRosier, Arthur H. Jr. (2015).
